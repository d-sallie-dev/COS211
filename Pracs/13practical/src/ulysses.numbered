00001 ULYSSES by James Joyce, 1922
00002 
00003  I --
00004 
00005 Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
00006 lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,
00007 ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He
00008 held the bowl aloft and intoned:
00009 
00010 Introibo ad altare Dei_.
00011 
00012 Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:
00013 
00014 Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
00015 
00016 Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about
00017 and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
00018 awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
00019 towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
00020 and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
00021 his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
00022 gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
00023 untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.
00024 
00025 Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
00026 bowl smartly.
00027 
00028 Back to barracks! he said sternly.
00029 
00030 He added in a preacher's tone:
00031 
00032 For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
00033 and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One
00034 moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.
00035 
00036 He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
00037 awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there
00038 with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered
00039 through the calm.
00040 
00041 Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off
00042 the current, will you?
00043 
00044 He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
00045 about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and
00046 sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.
00047 A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.
00048 
00049 The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!
00050 
00051 He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
00052 laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
00053 halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
00054 he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
00055 lathered cheeks and neck.
00056 
00057 Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on.
00058 
00059 My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a
00060 Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.
00061 We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
00062 twenty quid?
00063 
00064 He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:
00065 
00066 Will he come? The jejune jesuit!
00067 
00068 Ceasing, he began to shave with care.
00069 
00070 Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.
00071 
00072 Yes, my love?
00073 
00074 How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?
00075 
00076 Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.
00077 
00078 God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks
00079 you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money
00080 and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you
00081 have the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you
00082 is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.
00083 
00084 He shaved warily over his chin.
00085 
00086 He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is
00087 his guncase?
00088 
00089 A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?
00090 
00091 I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark
00092 with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
00093 black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If
00094 he stays on here I am off.
00095 
00096 Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down
00097 from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.
00098 
00099 Scutter! he cried thickly.
00100 
00101 He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper
00102 pocket, said:
00103 
00104 Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.
00105 
00106 Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
00107 dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
00108 Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
00109 
00110 The bard's noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.
00111 You can almost taste it, can't you?
00112 
00113 He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
00114 oakpale hair stirring slightly.
00115 
00116 God! he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a grey
00117 sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa
00118 ponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them
00119 in the original. _Thalatta! Thalatta_! She is our great sweet mother.
00120 Come and look.
00121 
00122 Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked
00123 down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
00124 Kingstown.
00125 
00126 Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.
00127 
00128 He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's
00129 face.
00130 
00131 The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't
00132 let me have anything to do with you.
00133 
00134 Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.
00135 
00136 You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
00137 asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to
00138 think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
00139 pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you...
00140 
00141 He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant
00142 smile curled his lips.
00143 
00144 But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest
00145 mummer of them all!
00146 
00147 He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.
00148 
00149 Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
00150 his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.
00151 Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in
00152 a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its
00153 loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her
00154 breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
00155 wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
00156 great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay
00157 and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had
00158 stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
00159 torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.
00160 
00161 Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.
00162 
00163 Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt
00164 and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?
00165 
00166 They fit well enough, Stephen answered.
00167 
00168 Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.
00169 
00170 The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God
00171 knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair
00172 stripe, grey. You'll look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You
00173 look damn well when you're dressed.
00174 
00175 Thanks, Stephen said. I can't wear them if they are grey.
00176 
00177 He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.
00178 Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey
00179 trousers.
00180 
00181 He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
00182 smooth skin.
00183 
00184 Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
00185 smokeblue mobile eyes.
00186 
00187 That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
00188 says you have g.p.i. He's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General
00189 paralysis of the insane!
00190 
00191 He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad
00192 in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and
00193 the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong
00194 wellknit trunk.
00195 
00196 Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!
00197 
00198 Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
00199 a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this
00200 face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.
00201 
00202 I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her
00203 all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead
00204 him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.
00205 
00206 Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes.
00207 
00208 The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If
00209 Wilde were only alive to see you!
00210 
00211 Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:
00212 
00213 It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant.
00214 
00215 Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him
00216 round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
00217 had thrust them.
00218 
00219 It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.
00220 God knows you have more spirit than any of them.
00221 
00222 Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The
00223 cold steelpen.
00224 
00225 Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap
00226 downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He's stinking with money and
00227 thinks you're not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling
00228 jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I
00229 could only work together we might do something for the island. Hellenise
00230 it.
00231 
00232 Cranly's arm. His arm.
00233 
00234 And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I'm the only one
00235 that knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more? What have you
00236 up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I'll
00237 bring down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave
00238 Clive Kempthorpe.
00239 
00240 Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. Palefaces:
00241 they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall
00242 expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit
00243 ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
00244 table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
00245 tailor's shears. A scared calf's face gilded with marmalade. I don't
00246 want to be debagged! Don't you play the giddy ox with me!
00247 
00248 Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf
00249 gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower
00250 on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.
00251 
00252 To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.
00253 
00254 Let him stay, Stephen said. There's nothing wrong with him except at
00255 night.
00256 
00257 Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I'm
00258 quite frank with you. What have you against me now?
00259 
00260 They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the
00261 water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.
00262 
00263 Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.
00264 
00265 Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don't remember anything.
00266 
00267 He looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,
00268 fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
00269 anxiety in his eyes.
00270 
00271 Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:
00272 
00273 Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's
00274 death?
00275 
00276 Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:
00277 
00278 What? Where? I can't remember anything. I remember only ideas and
00279 sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?
00280 
00281 You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to
00282 get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the
00283 drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.
00284 
00285 Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.
00286 
00287 You said, Stephen answered, _O, it's only Dedalus whose mother is
00288 beastly dead._
00289 
00290 A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
00291 Mulligan's cheek.
00292 
00293 Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?
00294 
00295 He shook his constraint from him nervously.
00296 
00297 And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? You
00298 saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
00299 Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It's a beastly
00300 thing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter. You wouldn't kneel
00301 down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?
00302 Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the
00303 wrong way. To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes
00304 are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
00305 buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it's over. You crossed her
00306 last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like
00307 some hired mute from Lalouette's. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I
00308 didn't mean to offend the memory of your mother.
00309 
00310 He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping
00311 wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
00312 
00313 I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.
00314 
00315 Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.
00316 
00317 Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.
00318 
00319 Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.
00320 
00321 O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.
00322 
00323 He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,
00324 gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew
00325 dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt
00326 the fever of his cheeks.
00327 
00328 A voice within the tower called loudly:
00329 
00330 Are you up there, Mulligan?
00331 
00332 I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered.
00333 
00334 He turned towards Stephen and said:
00335 
00336 Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,
00337 Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.
00338 
00339 His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
00340 with the roof:
00341 
00342 Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the
00343 moody brooding.
00344 
00345 His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
00346 the stairhead:
00347 
00348      _And no more turn aside and brood
00349      Upon love's bitter mystery
00350      For Fergus rules the brazen cars._
00351 
00352 
00353 Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
00354 stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of
00355 water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of
00356 the dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the
00357 harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words
00358 shimmering on the dim tide.
00359 
00360 A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
00361 deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus' song:
00362 I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her
00363 door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity
00364 I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those
00365 words, Stephen: love's bitter mystery.
00366 
00367 Where now?
00368 
00369 Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
00370 a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny
00371 window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the
00372 pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:
00373 
00374      _I am the boy
00375      That can enjoy
00376      Invisibility._
00377 
00378 
00379 Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.
00380 
00381 And no more turn aside and brood._
00382 
00383 
00384 Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his
00385 brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
00386 approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
00387 roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely
00388 fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's
00389 shirts.
00390 
00391 In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
00392 loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
00393 bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.
00394 
00395 Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me
00396 alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured
00397 face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on
00398 their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata rutilantium te
00399 confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat._
00400 
00401 Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!
00402 
00403 No, mother! Let me be and let me live.
00404 
00405 Kinch ahoy!
00406 
00407 Buck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the
00408 staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry,
00409 heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.
00410 
00411 Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is
00412 apologising for waking us last night. It's all right.
00413 
00414 I'm coming, Stephen said, turning.
00415 
00416 Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our
00417 sakes.
00418 
00419 His head disappeared and reappeared.
00420 
00421 I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever. Touch
00422 him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.
00423 
00424 I get paid this morning, Stephen said.
00425 
00426 The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.
00427 
00428 If you want it, Stephen said.
00429 
00430 Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We'll
00431 have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent
00432 sovereigns.
00433 
00434 He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
00435 tune with a Cockney accent:
00436 
00437      _O, won't we have a merry time,
00438      Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
00439      On coronation,
00440      Coronation day!
00441      O, won't we have a merry time
00442      On coronation day!_
00443 
00444 
00445 Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,
00446 forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there
00447 all day, forgotten friendship?
00448 
00449 He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
00450 smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.
00451 So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and
00452 yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.
00453 
00454 In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form
00455 moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
00456 yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
00457 from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
00458 coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.
00459 
00460 We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?
00461 
00462 Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the
00463 hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
00464 the inner doors.
00465 
00466 Have you the key? a voice asked.
00467 
00468 Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I'm choked!
00469 
00470 He howled, without looking up from the fire:
00471 
00472 Kinch!
00473 
00474 It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.
00475 
00476 The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
00477 set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the
00478 doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
00479 sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
00480 him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
00481 them down heavily and sighed with relief.
00482 
00483 I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a
00484 word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,
00485 come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.
00486 Where's the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk.
00487 
00488 Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
00489 the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.
00490 
00491 What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.
00492 
00493 We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There's a lemon in the
00494 locker.
00495 
00496 O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove
00497 milk.
00498 
00499 Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
00500 
00501 That woman is coming up with the milk.
00502 
00503 The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
00504 chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,
00505 I can't go fumbling at the damned eggs.
00506 
00507 He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
00508 plates, saying:
00509 
00510 In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._
00511 
00512 Haines sat down to pour out the tea.
00513 
00514 I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do
00515 make strong tea, don't you?
00516 
00517 Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's
00518 wheedling voice:
00519 
00520 When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
00521 makes water I makes water.
00522 
00523 By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
00524 
00525 Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
00526 
00527 So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma'am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
00528 send you don't make them in the one pot._
00529 
00530 He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
00531 on his knife.
00532 
00533 That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five
00534 lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
00535 Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.
00536 
00537 He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
00538 brows:
00539 
00540 Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken
00541 of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?
00542 
00543 I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.
00544 
00545 Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?
00546 
00547 I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
00548 Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.
00549 
00550 Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight.
00551 
00552 Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
00553 and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!
00554 
00555 Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
00556 rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
00557 
00558      _--For old Mary Ann
00559      She doesn't care a damn.
00560      But, hising up her petticoats..._
00561 
00562 
00563 He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.
00564 
00565 The doorway was darkened by an entering form.
00566 
00567 The milk, sir!
00568 
00569 Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.
00570 
00571 An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow.
00572 
00573 That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.
00574 
00575 To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!
00576 
00577 Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.
00578 
00579 The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
00580 the collector of prepuces.
00581 
00582 How much, sir? asked the old woman.
00583 
00584 A quart, Stephen said.
00585 
00586 He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
00587 milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and
00588 a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe
00589 a messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
00590 Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her
00591 toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed
00592 about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old
00593 woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of
00594 an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common
00595 cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid,
00596 whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
00597 
00598 It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.
00599 
00600 Taste it, sir, she said.
00601 
00602 He drank at her bidding.
00603 
00604 If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
00605 loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
00606 guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with
00607 dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits.
00608 
00609 Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.
00610 
00611 I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered.
00612 
00613 Look at that now, she said.
00614 
00615 Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice
00616 that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
00617 slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
00618 is of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in
00619 God's likeness, the serpent's prey. And to the loud voice that now bids
00620 her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
00621 
00622 Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.
00623 
00624 Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.
00625 
00626 Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.
00627 
00628 Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
00629 
00630 I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the
00631 west, sir?
00632 
00633 I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
00634 
00635 He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
00636 Irish in Ireland.
00637 
00638 Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak
00639 the language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows.
00640 
00641 Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill
00642 us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma'am?
00643 
00644 No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
00645 milkcan on her forearm and about to go.
00646 
00647 Haines said to her:
00648 
00649 Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?
00650 
00651 Stephen filled again the three cups.
00652 
00653 Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it's seven mornings a pint at
00654 twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
00655 mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That's a
00656 shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.
00657 
00658 Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
00659 buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
00660 trouser pockets.
00661 
00662 Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
00663 
00664 Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
00665 thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
00666 his fingers and cried:
00667 
00668 A miracle!
00669 
00670 He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
00671 
00672 Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.
00673 
00674 Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.
00675 
00676 We'll owe twopence, he said.
00677 
00678 Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good
00679 morning, sir.
00680 
00681 She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant:
00682 
00683      _--Heart of my heart, were it more,
00684      More would be laid at your feet._
00685 
00686 
00687 He turned to Stephen and said:
00688 
00689 Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring
00690 us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland
00691 expects that every man this day will do his duty.
00692 
00693 That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
00694 national library today.
00695 
00696 Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.
00697 
00698 He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
00699 
00700 Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?
00701 
00702 Then he said to Haines:
00703 
00704 The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.
00705 
00706 All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
00707 trickle over a slice of the loaf.
00708 
00709 Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
00710 loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
00711 
00712 I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.
00713 
00714 Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.
00715 Conscience. Yet here's a spot.
00716 
00717 That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
00718 of Irish art is deuced good.
00719 
00720 Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth
00721 of tone:
00722 
00723 Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.
00724 
00725 Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just
00726 thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.
00727 
00728 Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.
00729 
00730 Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
00731 the hammock, said:
00732 
00733 I don't know, I'm sure.
00734 
00735 He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and
00736 said with coarse vigour:
00737 
00738 You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?
00739 
00740 Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the
00741 milkwoman or from him. It's a toss up, I think.
00742 
00743 I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
00744 with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.
00745 
00746 I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.
00747 
00748 Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm.
00749 
00750 From me, Kinch, he said.
00751 
00752 In a suddenly changed tone he added:
00753 
00754 To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else they
00755 are good for. Why don't you play them as I do? To hell with them all.
00756 Let us get out of the kip.
00757 
00758 He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
00759 resignedly:
00760 
00761 Mulligan is stripped of his garments.
00762 
00763 He emptied his pockets on to the table.
00764 
00765 There's your snotrag, he said.
00766 
00767 And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
00768 chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and
00769 rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,
00770 we'll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and
00771 green boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I
00772 contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of
00773 his talking hands.
00774 
00775 And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said.
00776 
00777 Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the
00778 doorway:
00779 
00780 Are you coming, you fellows?
00781 
00782 I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,
00783 Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out
00784 with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
00785 
00786 And going forth he met Butterly.
00787 
00788 Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
00789 and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
00790 locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.
00791 
00792 At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
00793 
00794 Did you bring the key?
00795 
00796 I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.
00797 
00798 He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
00799 bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.
00800 
00801 Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
00802 
00803 Haines asked:
00804 
00805 Do you pay rent for this tower?
00806 
00807 Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.
00808 
00809 To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.
00810 
00811 They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
00812 
00813 Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?
00814 
00815 Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
00816 the sea. But ours is the _omphalos_.
00817 
00818 What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.
00819 
00820 No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas
00821 and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I
00822 have a few pints in me first.
00823 
00824 He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
00825 primrose waistcoat:
00826 
00827 You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?
00828 
00829 It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.
00830 
00831 You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?
00832 
00833 Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.
00834 It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is
00835 Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
00836 father.
00837 
00838 What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?
00839 
00840 Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
00841 loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:
00842 
00843 O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
00844 
00845 We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is
00846 rather long to tell.
00847 
00848 Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.
00849 
00850 The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.
00851 
00852 I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
00853 tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That beetles
00854 o'er his base into the sea,_ isn't it?
00855 
00856 Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did
00857 not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in
00858 cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.
00859 
00860 It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.
00861 
00862 Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.
00863 The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
00864 smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
00865 tacking by the Muglins.
00866 
00867 I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.
00868 The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the
00869 Father.
00870 
00871 Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked
00872 at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
00873 suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved
00874 a doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
00875 began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
00876 
00877      _--I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
00878      My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.
00879      With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.
00880      So here's to disciples and Calvary._
00881 
00882 
00883 He held up a forefinger of warning.
00884 
00885      _--If anyone thinks that I amn't divine
00886      He'll get no free drinks when I'm making the wine
00887      But have to drink water and wish it were plain
00888      That i make when the wine becomes water again._
00889 
00890 
00891 He tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running forward
00892 to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or
00893 wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
00894 
00895      _--Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
00896      And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.
00897      What's bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
00898      And Olivet's breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_
00899 
00900 
00901 He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
00902 winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh
00903 wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.
00904 
00905 Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
00906 said:
00907 
00908 We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a
00909 believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
00910 it somehow, doesn't it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?
00911 
00912 The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.
00913 
00914 O, Haines said, you have heard it before?
00915 
00916 Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.
00917 
00918 You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in
00919 the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a
00920 personal God.
00921 
00922 There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.
00923 
00924 Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
00925 green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.
00926 
00927 Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.
00928 
00929 Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his
00930 sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
00931 it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
00932 towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.
00933 
00934 Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe
00935 or you don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a
00936 personal God. You don't stand for that, I suppose?
00937 
00938 You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
00939 example of free thought.
00940 
00941 He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
00942 side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.
00943 My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line
00944 along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.
00945 He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt
00946 bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his
00947 eyes.
00948 
00949 After all, Haines began...
00950 
00951 Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not
00952 all unkind.
00953 
00954 After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your
00955 own master, it seems to me.
00956 
00957 I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
00958 Italian.
00959 
00960 Italian? Haines said.
00961 
00962 A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.
00963 
00964 And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.
00965 
00966 Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?
00967 
00968 The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
00969 the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.
00970 
00971 Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
00972 spoke.
00973 
00974 I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think
00975 like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather
00976 unfairly. It seems history is to blame.
00977 
00978 The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph
00979 of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam
00980 ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own
00981 rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the
00982 mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
00983 affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
00984 militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies
00985 fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of
00986 whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
00987 consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning
00988 Christ's terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
00989 held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken
00990 a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void
00991 awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
00992 worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael's host,
00993 who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
00994 shields.
00995 
00996 Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_
00997 
00998 Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines's voice said, and I feel as one. I
00999 don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.
01000 That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now.
01001 
01002 Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.
01003 
01004 She's making for Bullock harbour.
01005 
01006 The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.
01007 
01008 There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way
01009 when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today.
01010 
01011 The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
01012 for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
01013 saltwhite. Here I am.
01014 
01015 They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on
01016 a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.
01017 A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise
01018 his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.
01019 
01020 Is the brother with you, Malachi?
01021 
01022 Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.
01023 
01024 Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
01025 thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.
01026 
01027 Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
01028 
01029 Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
01030 the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,
01031 water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
01032 rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
01033 sagging loincloth.
01034 
01035 Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
01036 and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
01037 and breastbone.
01038 
01039 Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
01040 rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.
01041 
01042 Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
01043 
01044 Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?
01045 
01046 Yes.
01047 
01048 Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with
01049 money.
01050 
01051 Is she up the pole?
01052 
01053 Better ask Seymour that.
01054 
01055 Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
01056 
01057 He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
01058 tritely:
01059 
01060 Redheaded women buck like goats.
01061 
01062 He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.
01063 
01064 My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the _Uebermensch._ Toothless
01065 Kinch and I, the supermen.
01066 
01067 He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
01068 clothes lay.
01069 
01070 Are you going in here, Malachi?
01071 
01072 Yes. Make room in the bed.
01073 
01074 The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached
01075 the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a
01076 stone, smoking.
01077 
01078 Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
01079 
01080 Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
01081 
01082 Stephen turned away.
01083 
01084 I'm going, Mulligan, he said.
01085 
01086 Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.
01087 
01088 Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
01089 clothes.
01090 
01091 And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
01092 
01093 Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
01094 Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
01095 
01096 He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
01097 Zarathustra.
01098 
01099 His plump body plunged.
01100 
01101 We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
01102 path and smiling at wild Irish.
01103 
01104 Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.
01105 
01106 The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.
01107 
01108 Good, Stephen said.
01109 
01110 He walked along the upwardcurving path.
01111 
01112      _Liliata rutilantium.
01113      Turma circumdet.
01114      Iubilantium te virginum._
01115 
01116 
01117 The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will
01118 not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
01119 
01120 A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning
01121 the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a
01122 seal's, far out on the water, round.
01123 
01124 Usurper.
01125 
01126 
01127 
01128 You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?
01129 
01130 Tarentum, sir.
01131 
01132 Very good. Well?
01133 
01134 There was a battle, sir.
01135 
01136 Very good. Where?
01137 
01138 The boy's blank face asked the blank window.
01139 
01140 Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as
01141 memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake's wings
01142 of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
01143 masonry, and time one livid final flame. What's left us then?
01144 
01145 I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
01146 
01147 Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
01148 gorescarred book.
01149 
01150 Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done
01151 for._
01152 
01153 That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From
01154 a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
01155 leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.
01156 
01157 You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
01158 
01159 End of Pyrrhus, sir?
01160 
01161 I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
01162 
01163 Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
01164 
01165 A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them
01166 between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
01167 the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud
01168 that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.
01169 
01170 Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
01171 
01172 All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round
01173 at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
01174 more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
01175 
01176 Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,
01177 what is a pier.
01178 
01179 A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a
01180 bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.
01181 
01182 Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
01183 whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.
01184 All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their
01185 likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
01186 tittering in the struggle.
01187 
01188 Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
01189 
01190 The words troubled their gaze.
01191 
01192 How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.
01193 
01194 For Haines's chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild
01195 drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A
01196 jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
01197 clement master's praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly
01198 for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other
01199 too often heard, their land a pawnshop.
01200 
01201 Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
01202 been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has
01203 branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
01204 possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing
01205 that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?
01206 Weave, weaver of the wind.
01207 
01208 Tell us a story, sir.
01209 
01210 O, do, sir. A ghoststory.
01211 
01212 Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.
01213 
01214 Weep no more,_ Comyn said.
01215 
01216 Go on then, Talbot.
01217 
01218 And the story, sir?
01219 
01220 After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.
01221 
01222 A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
01223 of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
01224 
01225      _--Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
01226      For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
01227      Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._
01228 
01229 
01230 It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.
01231 Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
01232 out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he
01233 had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow
01234 a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains
01235 about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and
01236 in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of
01237 brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of
01238 thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the
01239 soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of
01240 forms.
01241 
01242 Talbot repeated:
01243 
01244      _--Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
01245      Through the dear might..._
01246 
01247 
01248 Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don't see anything.
01249 
01250 What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.
01251 
01252 His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having
01253 just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these
01254 craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and
01255 on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
01256 tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. A long
01257 look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the
01258 church's looms. Ay.
01259 
01260      _Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
01261      My father gave me seeds to sow._
01262 
01263 
01264 Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.
01265 
01266 Have I heard all? Stephen asked.
01267 
01268 Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.
01269 
01270 Half day, sir. Thursday.
01271 
01272 Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.
01273 
01274 They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
01275 Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling
01276 gaily:
01277 
01278 A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.
01279 
01280 O, ask me, sir.
01281 
01282 A hard one, sir.
01283 
01284 This is the riddle, Stephen said:
01285 
01286      _The cock crew,
01287      The sky was blue:
01288      The bells in heaven
01289      Were striking eleven.
01290      'Tis time for this poor soul
01291      To go to heaven._
01292 
01293 
01294 What is that?
01295 
01296 What, sir?
01297 
01298 Again, sir. We didn't hear.
01299 
01300 Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
01301 Cochrane said:
01302 
01303 What is it, sir? We give it up.
01304 
01305 Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
01306 
01307 The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.
01308 
01309 He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
01310 echoed dismay.
01311 
01312 A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
01313 
01314 Hockey!
01315 
01316 They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
01317 they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
01318 clamour of their boots and tongues.
01319 
01320 Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
01321 copybook. His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
01322 and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
01323 cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
01324 and damp as a snail's bed.
01325 
01326 He held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.
01327 Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
01328 blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.
01329 
01330 Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them
01331 to you, sir.
01332 
01333 Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.
01334 
01335 Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.
01336 
01337 Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to
01338 copy them off the board, sir.
01339 
01340 Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.
01341 
01342 No, sir.
01343 
01344 Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snail's
01345 bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.
01346 But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot,
01347 a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained
01348 from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His
01349 mother's prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.
01350 She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire,
01351 an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being
01352 trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul
01353 gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek
01354 of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,
01355 listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.
01356 
01357 Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra
01358 that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. Sargent peered askance
01359 through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the
01360 hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.
01361 
01362 Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
01363 their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,
01364 traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from
01365 the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement,
01366 flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a
01367 darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.
01368 
01369 Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?
01370 
01371 Yes, sir.
01372 
01373 In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word
01374 of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of
01375 shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective and
01376 objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed
01377 him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.
01378 
01379 Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My
01380 childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
01381 lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony
01382 sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
01383 tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
01384 
01385 The sum was done.
01386 
01387 It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.
01388 
01389 Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.
01390 
01391 He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
01392 copybook back to his bench.
01393 
01394 You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
01395 as he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form.
01396 
01397 Yes, sir.
01398 
01399 In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.
01400 
01401 Sargent!
01402 
01403 Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.
01404 
01405 He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
01406 field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and
01407 Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When
01408 he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He
01409 turned his angry white moustache.
01410 
01411 What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
01412 
01413 Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.
01414 
01415 Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
01416 order here.
01417 
01418 And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice
01419 cried sternly:
01420 
01421 What is the matter? What is it now?
01422 
01423 Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
01424 round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
01425 
01426 Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather
01427 of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was
01428 in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins,
01429 base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase
01430 of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the
01431 gentiles: world without end.
01432 
01433 A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
01434 rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
01435 
01436 First, our little financial settlement, he said.
01437 
01438 He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
01439 slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
01440 laid them carefully on the table.
01441 
01442 Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.
01443 
01444 And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved
01445 over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
01446 cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and
01447 this, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim's hoard, dead treasure,
01448 hollow shells.
01449 
01450 A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.
01451 
01452 Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.
01453 These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for
01454 shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.
01455 
01456 He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.
01457 
01458 Three twelve, he said. I think you'll find that's right.
01459 
01460 Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
01461 haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.
01462 
01463 No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.
01464 
01465 Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too
01466 of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and
01467 misery.
01468 
01469 Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You'll pull it out somewhere
01470 and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very
01471 handy.
01472 
01473 Answer something.
01474 
01475 Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.
01476 
01477 The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times
01478 now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant
01479 if I will.
01480 
01481 Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don't
01482 know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I
01483 have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say?
01484 Put but money in thy purse._
01485 
01486 Iago, Stephen murmured.
01487 
01488 He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare.
01489 
01490 He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but
01491 an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you
01492 know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's
01493 mouth?
01494 
01495 The seas' ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
01496 history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.
01497 
01498 That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.
01499 
01500 Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That's not English. A French Celt said that. He
01501 tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.
01502 
01503 I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paid
01504 my way._
01505 
01506 Good man, good man.
01507 
01508 I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel
01509 that? _I owe nothing._ Can you?
01510 
01511 Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.
01512 Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.
01513 Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
01514 Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
01515 weeks' board. The lump I have is useless.
01516 
01517 For the moment, no, Stephen answered.
01518 
01519 Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.
01520 
01521 I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.
01522 We are a generous people but we must also be just.
01523 
01524 I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.
01525 
01526 Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
01527 shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
01528 Wales.
01529 
01530 You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.
01531 I saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the famine in
01532 '46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
01533 union twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your
01534 communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.
01535 
01536 Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
01537 splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the
01538 planters' covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie
01539 down.
01540 
01541 Stephen sketched a brief gesture.
01542 
01543 I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But
01544 I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are
01545 all Irish, all kings' sons.
01546 
01547 Alas, Stephen said.
01548 
01549 Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for
01550 it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do
01551 so.
01552 
01553      _Lal the ral the ra
01554      The rocky road to Dublin._
01555 
01556 
01557 A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!
01558 Soft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling
01559 on to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.
01560 
01561 That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
01562 with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.
01563 Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.
01564 
01565 He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
01566 off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.
01567 
01568 Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of
01569 common sense._ Just a moment.
01570 
01571 He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
01572 and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
01573 sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.
01574 
01575 Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed
01576 around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
01577 heads poised in air: lord Hastings' Repulse, the duke of Westminster's
01578 Shotover, the duke of Beaufort's Ceylon, _prix de Paris_, 1866. Elfin
01579 riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king's
01580 colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.
01581 
01582 Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this
01583 allimportant question...
01584 
01585 Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
01586 mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
01587 of the canteen, over the motley slush. Fair Rebel! Fair Rebel! Even
01588 money the favourite: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers
01589 we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past
01590 the meatfaced woman, a butcher's dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of
01591 orange.
01592 
01593 Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.
01594 
01595 Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley,
01596 the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems
01597 to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.
01598 Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain,
01599 a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.
01600 
01601 Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.
01602 
01603 He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.
01604 
01605 I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It's about
01606 the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two
01607 opinions on the matter.
01608 
01609 May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of _laissez faire_
01610 which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old
01611 industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.
01612 European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of
01613 the channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
01614 agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who
01615 was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.
01616 
01617 I don't mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.
01618 
01619 Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch's preparation. Serum and virus.
01620 Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor's horses at Murzsteg,
01621 lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous
01622 offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In
01623 every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for the
01624 hospitality of your columns.
01625 
01626 I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the
01627 next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can
01628 be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
01629 regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They
01630 offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with
01631 the department. Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by
01632 difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...
01633 
01634 He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.
01635 
01636 Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the
01637 jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are
01638 the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the
01639 nation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure
01640 as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
01641 destruction. Old England is dying.
01642 
01643 He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
01644 broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.
01645 
01646 Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.
01647 
01648      _The harlot's cry from street to street
01649      Shall weave old England's windingsheet._
01650 
01651 
01652 His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
01653 he halted.
01654 
01655 A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
01656 gentile, is he not?
01657 
01658 They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see
01659 the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the
01660 earth to this day.
01661 
01662 On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
01663 prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
01664 uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
01665 hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full
01666 slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but
01667 knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain
01668 patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard
01669 heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their
01670 years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.
01671 
01672 Who has not? Stephen said.
01673 
01674 What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
01675 
01676 He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell
01677 sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.
01678 
01679 History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.
01680 
01681 From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
01682 What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?
01683 
01684 The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human
01685 history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.
01686 
01687 Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
01688 
01689 That is God.
01690 
01691 Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
01692 
01693 What? Mr Deasy asked.
01694 
01695 A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
01696 
01697 Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
01698 between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.
01699 
01700 I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and
01701 many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no
01702 better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
01703 years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the
01704 strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman, O'Rourke,
01705 prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many
01706 failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my
01707 days. But I will fight for the right till the end.
01708 
01709      _For Ulster will fight
01710      And Ulster will be right._
01711 
01712 
01713 Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.
01714 
01715 Well, sir, he began...
01716 
01717 I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long
01718 at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
01719 wrong.
01720 
01721 A learner rather, Stephen said.
01722 
01723 And here what will you learn more?
01724 
01725 Mr Deasy shook his head.
01726 
01727 Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great
01728 teacher.
01729 
01730 Stephen rustled the sheets again.
01731 
01732 As regards these, he began.
01733 
01734 Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
01735 published at once.
01736 
01737  Telegraph. Irish Homestead._
01738 
01739 I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
01740 editors slightly.
01741 
01742 That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
01743 M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the
01744 City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
01745 see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?
01746 
01747 The Evening Telegraph..._
01748 
01749 That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
01750 answer that letter from my cousin.
01751 
01752 Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
01753 Thank you.
01754 
01755 Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
01756 like to break a lance with you, old as I am.
01757 
01758 Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
01759 
01760 He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
01761 hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.
01762 The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
01763 toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub
01764 me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.
01765 
01766 Mr Dedalus!
01767 
01768 Running after me. No more letters, I hope.
01769 
01770 Just one moment.
01771 
01772 Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
01773 
01774 Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.
01775 
01776 I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
01777 being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know
01778 that? No. And do you know why?
01779 
01780 He frowned sternly on the bright air.
01781 
01782 Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
01783 
01784 Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.
01785 
01786 A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
01787 rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
01788 his lifted arms waving to the air.
01789 
01790 She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
01791 stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.
01792 
01793 On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
01794 spangles, dancing coins.
01795 
01796 
01797 Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
01798 through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn
01799 and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver,
01800 rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.
01801 Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By
01802 knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a
01803 millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_. Limit of the diaphane in. Why
01804 in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it
01805 is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.
01806 
01807 
01808 Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
01809 shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time.
01810 A very short space of time through very short times of space. Five, six:
01811 the _nacheinander_. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the
01812 audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles
01813 o'er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am
01814 getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with
01815 it: they do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs,
01816 nebeneinander_. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.
01817 Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick,
01818 crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a'. Won't you come to
01819 Sandymount, Madeline the mare?
01820 
01821 
01822 Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. Acatalectic tetrameter of iambs
01823 marching. No, agallop: _deline the mare_.
01824 
01825 Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I
01826 open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. _Basta_! I will see if I
01827 can see.
01828 
01829 See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world
01830 without end.
01831 
01832 They came down the steps from Leahy's terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_:
01833 and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in
01834 the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.
01835 Number one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's gamp poked in
01836 the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe,
01837 relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One
01838 of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing.
01839 What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed
01840 in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of
01841 all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your
01842 omphalos. Hello! Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha:
01843 nought, nought, one.
01844 
01845 Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel.
01846 Gaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum,
01847 no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to
01848 everlasting. Womb of sin.
01849 
01850 Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man
01851 with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.
01852 They clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. From before the ages
01853 He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A _lex eterna_ stays
01854 about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are
01855 consubstantial? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring
01856 his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred
01857 heresiarch' In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia.
01858 With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of
01859 a widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.
01860 
01861 Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves.
01862 The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of
01863 Mananaan.
01864 
01865 I mustn't forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half
01866 twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.
01867 
01868 Yes, I must.
01869 
01870 His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara's or not? My
01871 consubstantial father's voice. Did you see anything of your artist
01872 brother Stephen lately? No? Sure he's not down in Strasburg terrace with
01873 his aunt Sally? Couldn't he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And and and
01874 and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the things I
01875 married into! De boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little costdrawer
01876 and his brother, the cornet player. Highly respectable gondoliers! And
01877 skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir.
01878 Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!
01879 
01880 I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take
01881 me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.
01882 
01883 It's Stephen, sir.
01884 
01885 Let him in. Let Stephen in.
01886 
01887 A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.
01888 
01889 We thought you were someone else.
01890 
01891 In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the
01892 hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed the
01893 upper moiety.
01894 
01895 Morrow, nephew.
01896 
01897 He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for
01898 the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and
01899 common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_. A bogoak frame over his
01900 bald head: Wilde's _Requiescat_. The drone of his misleading whistle
01901 brings Walter back.
01902 
01903 Yes, sir?
01904 
01905 Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?
01906 
01907 Bathing Crissie, sir.
01908 
01909 Papa's little bedpal. Lump of love.
01910 
01911 No, uncle Richie...
01912 
01913 Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!
01914 
01915 Uncle Richie, really...
01916 
01917 Sit down or by the law Harry I'll knock you down.
01918 
01919 Walter squints vainly for a chair.
01920 
01921 He has nothing to sit down on, sir.
01922 
01923 He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair.
01924 Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs
01925 here. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the
01926 better. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.
01927 
01928 All'erta_!
01929 
01930 He drones bars of Ferrando's _aria di sortita_. The grandest number,
01931 Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.
01932 
01933 His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air,
01934 his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.
01935 
01936 This wind is sweeter.
01937 
01938 Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you
01939 had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of
01940 them, Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh's
01941 library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom?
01942 The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind
01943 ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon,
01944 his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine
01945 faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. Abbas
01946 father,--furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains? Paff!
01947 Descende, calve, ut ne amplius decalveris_. A garland of grey hair
01948 on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace
01949 descende_!), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down, baldpoll!
01950 A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar's horns,
01951 the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured
01952 and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.
01953 
01954 And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating
01955 it. Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.
01956 Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own
01957 cheek. Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that,
01958 invincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled
01959 his brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his
01960 second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,
01961 rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang
01962 in diphthong.
01963 
01964 Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were
01965 awfully holy, weren't you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you
01966 might not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue
01967 that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the
01968 wet street. _O si, certo_! Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned
01969 round a squaw. More tell me, more still!! On the top of the Howth tram
01970 alone crying to the rain: Naked women! _naked women_! What about that,
01971 eh?
01972 
01973 What about what? What else were they invented for?
01974 
01975 Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young.
01976 You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause
01977 earnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one
01978 saw: tell no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for titles.
01979 Have you read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. O
01980 yes, W. Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply
01981 deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the
01982 world, including Alexandria? Someone was to read them there after a few
01983 thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della Mirandola like. Ay, very
01984 like a whale. When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one
01985 feels that one is at one with one who once...
01986 
01987 The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again
01988 a damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the
01989 unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.
01990 Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing
01991 upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a
01992 midden of man's ashes. He coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle
01993 stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel:
01994 isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze
01995 of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the
01996 higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams
01997 of brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.
01998 
01999 He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara's. Am I not going there?
02000 Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand
02001 towards the Pigeonhouse.
02002 
02003 Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?_
02004 
02005 c'est le pigeon, Joseph._
02006 
02007 Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon.
02008 Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father's a bird, he
02009 lapped the sweet _lait chaud_ with pink young tongue, plump bunny's
02010 face. Lap, _lapin._ He hopes to win in the _gros lots_. About the nature
02011 of women he read in Michelet. But he must send me _La Vie de Jesus_ by
02012 M. Leo Taxil. Lent it to his friend.
02013 
02014 C'est tordant, vous savez. Moi, je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas
02015 en l'existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire a mon p-re._
02016 
02017 Il croit?_
02018 
02019 Mon pere, oui._
02020 
02021 Schluss_. He laps.
02022 
02023 My Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want
02024 puce gloves. You were a student, weren't you? Of what in the other
02025 devil's name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: _physiques, chimiques et
02026 naturelles_. Aha. Eating your groatsworth of _mou en civet_, fleshpots
02027 of Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen. Just say in the most natural
02028 tone: when I was in Paris; _boul' Mich'_, I used to. Yes, used to
02029 carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder
02030 somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the
02031 prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me.
02032 Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. _Lui, c'est moi_. You seem to have enjoyed
02033 yourself.
02034 
02035 Proudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a
02036 dispossessed. With mother's money order, eight shillings, the banging
02037 door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger
02038 toothache. _Encore deux minutes_. Look clock. Must get. _Ferme_. Hired
02039 dog! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered
02040 walls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not
02041 hurt? O, that's all right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O, that's
02042 all right. Shake a shake. O, that's all only all right.
02043 
02044 You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery
02045 Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from
02046 their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: _Euge! Euge_! Pretending to speak
02047 broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across
02048 the slimy pier at Newhaven. _Comment?_ Rich booty you brought back; _Le
02049 Tutu_, five tattered numbers of _Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge_; a
02050 blue French telegram, curiosity to show:
02051 
02052 Mother dying come home father.
02053 
02054 The aunt thinks you killed your mother. That's why she won't.
02055 
02056      _Then here's a health to Mulligan's aunt
02057      And I'll tell you the reason why.
02058      She always kept things decent in
02059      The Hannigan famileye._
02060 
02061 
02062 His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by
02063 the boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone
02064 mammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is
02065 there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.
02066 
02067 Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of
02068 farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court
02069 the air. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife, the
02070 kerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In
02071 Rodot's Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering
02072 with gold teeth _chaussons_ of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the
02073 pus_ of _flan breton_. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased
02074 pleasers, curled conquistadores.
02075 
02076 Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers
02077 smeared with printer's ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his
02078 white. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. _Un demi
02079 setier!_ A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves me
02080 at his beck. _Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux irlandais,
02081 nous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui!_ She thought you wanted a cheese
02082 hollandais_. Your postprandial, do you know that word? Postprandial.
02083 There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer fellow, used to call
02084 it his postprandial. Well: _slainte_! Around the slabbed tables the
02085 tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His breath hangs over our
02086 saucestained plates, the green fairy's fang thrusting between his lips.
02087 Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith
02088 now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of men. To yoke me as his yokefellow,
02089 our crimes our common cause. You're your father's son. I know the voice.
02090 His fustian shirt, sanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at
02091 his secrets. M. Drumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called
02092 queen Victoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. _Vieille ogresse_
02093 with the _dents jaunes_. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, _La Patrie_, M.
02094 Millevoye, Felix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken,
02095 bonne a tout faire_, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala.
02096 Moi faire_, she said, _Tous les messieurs_. Not this _Monsieur_, I
02097 said. Most licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn't let
02098 my brother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes,
02099 I see you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.
02100 
02101 The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose
02102 tobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw
02103 facebones under his peep of day boy's hat. How the head centre got away,
02104 authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil, orangeblossoms,
02105 drove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the
02106 betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.
02107 
02108 Spurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell you.
02109 I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her love he
02110 prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls
02111 of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward
02112 in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay Paree he hides,
02113 Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his day's stations,
02114 the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps
02115 short night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, damascened with flyblown faces of
02116 the gone. Loveless, landless, wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy
02117 without her outcast man, madame in rue Git-le-Coeur, canary and two
02118 buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young thing's.
02119 Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat you saw me, won't you? I wanted to
02120 get poor Pat a job one time. _Mon fils_, soldier of France. I taught him
02121 to sing _The boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades_. Know that old
02122 lay? I taught Patrice that. Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's
02123 castle on the Nore. Goes like this. O, O. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by
02124 the hand.
02125 
02126      _O, O THE BOYS OF
02127      KILKENNY..._
02128 
02129 
02130 Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.
02131 Remembering thee, O Sion.
02132 
02133 He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.
02134 The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of
02135 seeds of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,
02136 am I? He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the
02137 quaking soil. Turn back.
02138 
02139 Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly
02140 in new sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the
02141 barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my
02142 feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk,
02143 nightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait,
02144 their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned
02145 platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when
02146 this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their--blind
02147 bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted his
02148 feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take
02149 all, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon's
02150 midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing
02151 Elsinore's tempting flood.
02152 
02153 The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back
02154 then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge
02155 and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a
02156 grike.
02157 
02158 A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the
02159 gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. _Un coche ensabli_ Louis Veuillot
02160 called Gautier's prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind
02161 have silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren
02162 of weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and
02163 stones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout's toys. Mind you don't get one
02164 bang on the ear. I'm the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well
02165 boulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz odz
02166 an Iridzman.
02167 
02168 A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.
02169 Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not
02170 be master of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From
02171 farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,
02172 two. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.
02173 Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?
02174 
02175 Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
02176 bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings,
02177 torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the
02178 collar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,
02179 spouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city
02180 a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers' knives, running,
02181 scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and
02182 slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among
02183 them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering
02184 resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.
02185 
02186 The dog's bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I
02187 just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. _Terribilia meditans_. A
02188 primrose doublet, fortune's knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you
02189 pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The
02190 Bruce's brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,
02191 York's false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of
02192 a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion
02193 crowned. All kings' sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved
02194 men from drowning and you shake at a cur's yelping. But the courtiers
02195 who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of...
02196 We don't want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what he
02197 did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. _Nat|rlich_, put there for you.
02198 Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago off
02199 Maiden's rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it out. I
02200 would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water cold soft.
02201 When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't see! Who's
02202 behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in
02203 on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If
02204 I had land under my feet. I want his life still to be his, mine to be
02205 mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his
02206 death. I... With him together down... I could not save her. Waters:
02207 bitter death: lost.
02208 
02209 A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.
02210 
02211 Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on
02212 all sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made
02213 off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a
02214 lowskimming gull. The man's shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He
02215 turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a
02216 field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of
02217 the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His
02218 snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented
02219 towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking,
02220 plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.
02221 
02222 Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,
02223 soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped
02224 running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again
02225 reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as
02226 they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting from
02227 his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a
02228 calf's gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked
02229 round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like
02230 a dog all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes
02231 on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies
02232 poor dogsbody's body.
02233 
02234 Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!
02235 
02236 The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless
02237 kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He
02238 slunk back in a curve. Doesn't see me. Along by the edge of the mole he
02239 lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed
02240 against it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed
02241 quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His
02242 hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.
02243 Something he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand,
02244 dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand
02245 again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in
02246 spousebreach, vulturing the dead.
02247 
02248 After he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.
02249 Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That
02250 man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my
02251 face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red
02252 carpet spread. You will see who.
02253 
02254 Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet
02255 out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler
02256 strangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the
02257 ruffian and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and
02258 shellgrit crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face hair trailed.
02259 Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. When night hides
02260 her body's flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway
02261 where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in
02262 O'Loughlin's of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in rogues' rum lingo, for, O,
02263 my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend's whiteness under her rancid rags.
02264 Fumbally's lane that night: the tanyard smells.
02265 
02266      _White thy fambles, red thy gan
02267      And thy quarrons dainty is.
02268      Couch a hogshead with me then.
02269      In the darkmans clip and kiss._
02270 
02271 
02272 Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.
02273 Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: _thy quarrons
02274 dainty is_. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber
02275 on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.
02276 
02277 Passing now.
02278 
02279 A side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I
02280 am not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun's flaming
02281 sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps,
02282 trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in
02283 her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa
02284 ponton_, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep
02285 the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of
02286 death, ghostcandled. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. He comes, pale vampire,
02287 through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her
02288 mouth's kiss.
02289 
02290 Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.
02291 
02292 No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth's kiss.
02293 
02294 His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.
02295 Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
02296 ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring
02297 wayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's
02298 letter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.
02299 Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and
02300 scribbled words. That's twice I forgot to take slips from the library
02301 counter.
02302 
02303 His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till
02304 the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness
02305 shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there
02306 with his augur's rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid
02307 sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.
02308 I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.
02309 Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who
02310 ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white field.
02311 Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of Cloyne
02312 took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with
02313 coloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat:
02314 yes, that's right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat
02315 I see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in
02316 stereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is
02317 in our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our
02318 sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the
02319 more.
02320 
02321 She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue
02322 hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of
02323 the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges
02324 Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you
02325 were going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the
02326 braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a grief
02327 and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a
02328 pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and
02329 yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple dumplings,
02330 piuttosto_. Where are your wits?
02331 
02332 Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me
02333 soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.
02334 Sad too. Touch, touch me.
02335 
02336 He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled
02337 note and pencil into a pock his hat. His hat down on his eyes. That is
02338 Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. _Et
02339 vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona_. Alo! _Bonjour_. Welcome as the flowers
02340 in May. Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the
02341 southing sun. I am caught in this burning scene. Pan's hour, the faunal
02342 noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the
02343 tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is far.
02344 
02345      _And no more turn aside and brood._
02346 
02347 His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs,
02348 nebeneinander_. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein
02349 another's foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in
02350 tripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt's
02351 shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. _Tiens, quel petit pied!_
02352 Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde's love that dare not speak its
02353 name. His arm: Cranly's arm. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I
02354 am. As I am. All or not at all.
02355 
02356 In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
02357 greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float
02358 away. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the
02359 low rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a
02360 fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of
02361 waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops:
02362 flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It
02363 flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.
02364 
02365 Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and
02366 sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water
02367 swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:
02368 lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,
02369 they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,
02370 awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias
02371 patiens ingemiscit_. To no end gathered; vainly then released,
02372 forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of
02373 lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a
02374 toil of waters.
02375 
02376 Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he
02377 said. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose
02378 drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising
02379 saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.
02380 There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath the watery
02381 floor. We have him. Easy now.
02382 
02383 Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a
02384 spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.
02385 God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed
02386 mountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a
02387 urinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes
02388 upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to
02389 the sun.
02390 
02391 A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
02392 known to man. Old Father Ocean. _Prix de paris_: beware of imitations.
02393 Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.
02394 
02395 Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?
02396 Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,
02397 Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_. No. My cockle hat and staff and
02398 hismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.
02399 
02400 He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying
02401 still. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make
02402 their end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest
02403 day. Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn
02404 Tennyson, gentleman poet. _Gi`_. For the old hag with the yellow teeth.
02405 And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. _Gi`_. My teeth are very
02406 bad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a
02407 dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the
02408 superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?
02409 
02410 My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?
02411 
02412 His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.
02413 
02414 He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
02415 carefully. For the rest let look who will.
02416 
02417 Behind. Perhaps there is someone.
02418 
02419 He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the
02420 air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees,
02421 homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship. +
02422

02424 
02425 
02426  II --
02427 
02428 Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.
02429 He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
02430 liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all
02431 he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
02432 faintly scented urine.
02433 
02434 Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
02435 her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the
02436 kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel
02437 a bit peckish.
02438 
02439 The coals were reddening.
02440 
02441 Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like
02442 her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off
02443 the hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,
02444 its spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked
02445 stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.
02446 
02447 Mkgnao!
02448 
02449 O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.
02450 
02451 The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
02452 table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my
02453 head. Prr.
02454 
02455 Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:
02456 the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her
02457 tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his
02458 knees.
02459 
02460 Milk for the pussens, he said.
02461 
02462 Mrkgnao! the cat cried.
02463 
02464 They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we
02465 understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too.
02466 Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder
02467 what I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.
02468 
02469 Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the
02470 chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.
02471 
02472 Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.
02473 
02474 Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.
02475 
02476 She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
02477 and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits
02478 narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to
02479 the dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him,
02480 poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.
02481 
02482 Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.
02483 
02484 He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
02485 three times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they
02486 can't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or
02487 kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.
02488 
02489 He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this
02490 drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a
02491 mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better
02492 a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped
02493 slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough?
02494 To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round
02495 him. No.
02496 
02497 On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
02498 the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter
02499 she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.
02500 
02501 He said softly in the bare hall:
02502 
02503 I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.
02504 
02505 And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
02506 
02507 You don't want anything for breakfast?
02508 
02509 A sleepy soft grunt answered:
02510 
02511 Mn.
02512 
02513 No. She didn't want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
02514 as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.
02515 Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.
02516 Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for
02517 it. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction.
02518 Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At
02519 Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it.
02520 Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was
02521 farseeing.
02522 
02523 His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
02524 and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback
02525 pictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.
02526 The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's
02527 high grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip
02528 of paper. Quite safe.
02529 
02530 On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.
02531 In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe.
02532 No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled
02533 the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped
02534 gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I
02535 come back anyhow.
02536 
02537 He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
02538 seventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a
02539 warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black
02540 conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in
02541 that light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as
02542 he walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our
02543 daily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.
02544 Makes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
02545 dawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep
02546 it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand,
02547 strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old
02548 Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander
02549 through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet
02550 shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled
02551 pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel,
02552 sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well,
02553 meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the
02554 pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal,
02555 the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from
02556 her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High
02557 wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly's
02558 new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments
02559 what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.
02560 
02561 Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track
02562 of the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What
02563 Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a
02564 homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank
02565 of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule
02566 sun rising up in the north-west.
02567 
02568 He approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the
02569 flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
02570 whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the
02571 end of the city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as
02572 position. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from
02573 the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.
02574 
02575 Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an
02576 ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my
02577 bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
02578 the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him
02579 off to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to
02580 tell you? What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,
02581 they'd only be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.
02582 
02583 Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor
02584 Dignam, Mr O'Rourke.
02585 
02586 Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
02587 doorway:
02588 
02589 Good day, Mr O'Rourke.
02590 
02591 Good day to you.
02592 
02593 Lovely weather, sir.
02594 
02595 'Tis all that.
02596 
02597 Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county
02598 Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold,
02599 they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thin of the
02600 competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without
02601 passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down
02602 three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and
02603 drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the
02604 town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the job,
02605 see?
02606 
02607 How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels
02608 of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint
02609 Joseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air
02610 helps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee
02611 doubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At
02612 their joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.
02613 
02614 He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
02615 polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened
02616 in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,
02617 packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the
02618 lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood.
02619 
02620 A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He
02621 stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling
02622 the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and
02623 a half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.
02624 Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood.
02625 No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the
02626 clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt
02627 swings at each whack.
02628 
02629 The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
02630 blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.
02631 
02632 He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at
02633 Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter
02634 sanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round
02635 it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:
02636 read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
02637 rustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the
02638 beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
02639 breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm
02640 on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in
02641 their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and
02642 his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging,
02643 whack by whack by whack.
02644 
02645 The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
02646 sausages and made a red grimace.
02647 
02648 Now, my miss, he said.
02649 
02650 She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.
02651 
02652 Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,
02653 please?
02654 
02655 Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
02656 slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the
02657 morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood
02658 outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He
02659 sighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted
02660 toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.
02661 The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For
02662 another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like
02663 them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the
02664 wood.
02665 
02666 Threepence, please.
02667 
02668 His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.
02669 Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them
02670 on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
02671 disc by disc, into the till.
02672 
02673 Thank you, sir. Another time.
02674 
02675 A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze
02676 after an instant. No: better not: another time.
02677 
02678 Good morning, he said, moving away.
02679 
02680 Good morning, sir.
02681 
02682 No sign. Gone. What matter?
02683 
02684 He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:
02685 planters' company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish
02686 government and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel
02687 and construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.
02688 You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,
02689 oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial
02690 irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered
02691 for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the
02692 balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.
02693 
02694 Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.
02695 
02696 He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered
02697 olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in
02698 jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows
02699 the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons
02700 too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin's parade. And Mastiansky
02701 with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron's
02702 basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it
02703 to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild
02704 perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too,
02705 Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.
02706 Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,
02707 Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa,
02708 chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in
02709 soiled dungarees. There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn't
02710 see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that
02711 Norwegian captain's. Wonder if I'll meet him today. Watering cart. To
02712 provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.
02713 
02714 A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.
02715 
02716 No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead
02717 sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those
02718 waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it
02719 raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead
02720 names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the
02721 oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's, clutching a
02722 naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over
02723 all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born
02724 everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old
02725 woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world.
02726 
02727 Desolation.
02728 
02729 Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned
02730 into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins,
02731 chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here
02732 now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of
02733 the bed. Must begin again those Sandow's exercises. On the hands down.
02734 Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?
02735 Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:
02736 parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell
02737 the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her
02738 ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.
02739 
02740 Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
02741 sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a
02742 girl with gold hair on the wind.
02743 
02744 Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered
02745 them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.
02746 Mrs Marion.
02747 
02748 Poldy!
02749 
02750 Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
02751 yellow twilight towards her tousled head.
02752 
02753 Who are the letters for?
02754 
02755 He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.
02756 
02757 A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And
02758 a letter for you.
02759 
02760 He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her
02761 knees.
02762 
02763 Do you want the blind up?
02764 
02765 Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
02766 glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.
02767 
02768 That do? he asked, turning.
02769 
02770 She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
02771 
02772 She got the things, she said.
02773 
02774 He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
02775 slowly with a snug sigh.
02776 
02777 Hurry up with that tea, she said. I'm parched.
02778 
02779 The kettle is boiling, he said.
02780 
02781 But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
02782 linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.
02783 
02784 As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
02785 
02786 Poldy!
02787 
02788 What?
02789 
02790 Scald the teapot.
02791 
02792 On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and
02793 rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the
02794 kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off
02795 the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump
02796 of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed
02797 hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say they
02798 won't eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to
02799 her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He
02800 sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.
02801 
02802 Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:
02803 new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's
02804 seaside girls.
02805 
02806 The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown
02807 
02808 Derby, smiling. Silly Milly's birthday gift. Only five she was then. No,
02809 wait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces
02810 of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.
02811 
02812      _O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.
02813      You are my lookingglass from night to morning.
02814      I'd rather have you without a farthing
02815      Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden._
02816 
02817 
02818 Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous
02819 old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And
02820 the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into
02821 the parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! All we
02822 laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.
02823 
02824 He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
02825 teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on
02826 it? Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it
02827 upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.
02828 
02829 Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on
02830 the chair by the bedhead.
02831 
02832 What a time you were! she said.
02833 
02834 She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
02835 the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft
02836 bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder. The warmth
02837 of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the
02838 tea she poured.
02839 
02840 A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the
02841 act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.
02842 
02843 Who was the letter from? he asked.
02844 
02845 Bold hand. Marion.
02846 
02847 O, Boylan, she said. He's bringing the programme.
02848 
02849 What are you singing?
02850 
02851 La ci darem_ with J. C. Doyle, she said, and _Love's Old Sweet Song_.
02852 
02853 Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves
02854 next day. Like foul flowerwater.
02855 
02856 Would you like the window open a little?
02857 
02858 She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
02859 
02860 What time is the funeral?
02861 
02862 Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn't see the paper.
02863 
02864 Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
02865 drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
02866 stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.
02867 
02868 No: that book.
02869 
02870 Other stocking. Her petticoat.
02871 
02872 It must have fell down, she said.
02873 
02874 He felt here and there. _Voglio e non vorrei_. Wonder if she pronounces
02875 that right: _voglio_. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped
02876 and lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of
02877 the orangekeyed chamberpot.
02878 
02879 Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There's a word I wanted to
02880 ask you.
02881 
02882 She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,
02883 having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the
02884 text with the hairpin till she reached the word.
02885 
02886 Met him what? he asked.
02887 
02888 Here, she said. What does that mean?
02889 
02890 He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.
02891 
02892 Metempsychosis?
02893 
02894 Yes. Who's he when he's at home?
02895 
02896 Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That
02897 means the transmigration of souls.
02898 
02899 O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.
02900 
02901 He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes.
02902 The first night after the charades. Dolphin's Barn. He turned over
02903 the smudged pages. _Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_. Hello. Illustration.
02904 Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor
02905 naked. Sheet kindly lent. _The monster Maffei desisted and flung his
02906 victim from him with an oath_. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals.
02907 Trapeze at Hengler's. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your
02908 neck and we'll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so
02909 they metamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man's
02910 soul after he dies. Dignam's soul...
02911 
02912 Did you finish it? he asked.
02913 
02914 Yes, she said. There's nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the
02915 first fellow all the time?
02916 
02917 Never read it. Do you want another?
02918 
02919 Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock's. Nice name he has.
02920 
02921 She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.
02922 
02923 Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to
02924 Kearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that's the word.
02925 
02926 Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
02927 after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That
02928 we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
02929 planet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past
02930 lives.
02931 
02932 The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Bette remind
02933 her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?
02934 
02935 The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed. Given away with the Easter number
02936 of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you
02937 put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six
02938 I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked
02939 nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.
02940 
02941 He turned the pages back.
02942 
02943 Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They
02944 used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
02945 instance. What they called nymphs, for example.
02946 
02947 Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,
02948 inhaling through her arched nostrils.
02949 
02950 There's a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?
02951 
02952 The kidney! he cried suddenly.
02953 
02954 He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
02955 against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
02956 hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. Pungent smoke shot
02957 up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the
02958 fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.
02959 Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the
02960 scanty brown gravy trickle over it.
02961 
02962 Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.
02963 He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a
02964 forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant
02965 meat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread,
02966 sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about
02967 some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side,
02968 reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the
02969 gravy and raising it to his mouth.
02970 
02971 Dearest Papli
02972 
02973 Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me
02974 splendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got
02975 mummy's Iovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am
02976 getting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me
02977 and Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day
02978 and all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on
02979 Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to
02980 mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano
02981 downstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.
02982 There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
02983 cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan's (I was on the
02984 pop of writing Blazes Boylan's) song about those seaside girls. Tell him
02985 silly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest love
02986 
02987 Your fond daughter, MILLY.
02988 
02989 P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby. M.
02990 
02991 Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first
02992 birthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she
02993 was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old
02994 woman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew from
02995 the first poor little Rudy wouldn't live. Well, God is good, sir. She
02996 knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.
02997 
02998 His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.
02999 Hurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the
03000 XL Cafe about the bracelet. Wouldn't eat her cakes or speak or look.
03001 Saucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after
03002 piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do
03003 worse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler tea
03004 to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.
03005 
03006 O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has
03007 happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild
03008 piece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny.
03009 Ripening now.
03010 
03011 Vain: very.
03012 
03013 He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught
03014 her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a little.
03015 Was given milk too long. On the ERIN'S KING that day round the Kish.
03016 Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf
03017 loose in the wind with her hair. _All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your
03018 head it simply swirls._
03019 
03020 
03021 Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers' pockets,
03022 jarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.
03023 Pier with lamps, summer evening, band,
03024 
03025      _Those girls, those girls,
03026      Those lovely seaside girls._
03027 
03028 
03029 Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.
03030 Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
03031 braiding.
03032 
03033 A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen,
03034 yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen
03035 too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now.
03036 Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.
03037 
03038 Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass
03039 the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two
03040 and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or
03041 through M'Coy.
03042 
03043 The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
03044 nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing.
03045 Wants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait.
03046 Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear
03047 with her back to the fire too.
03048 
03049 He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,
03050 undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.
03051 
03052 Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I'm ready.
03053 
03054 Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the
03055 landing.
03056 
03057 A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as
03058 I'm.
03059 
03060 In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_. He folded it
03061 under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in
03062 soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.
03063 
03064 Listening, he heard her voice:
03065 
03066 Come, come, pussy. Come.
03067 
03068 He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen
03069 towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.
03070 The maid was in the garden. Fine morning.
03071 
03072 He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.
03073 Make a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to
03074 manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.
03075 All soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this
03076 that is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top
03077 dressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are
03078 fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid
03079 gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in
03080 that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens
03081 have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.
03082 
03083 He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the
03084 peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don't remember that. Hallstand
03085 too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.
03086 Drago's shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown
03087 brillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder
03088 have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox
03089 there got away James Stephens, they say. O'Brien.
03090 
03091 Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.
03092 Enthusiast.
03093 
03094 He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get
03095 these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head
03096 under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
03097 limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he
03098 peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his
03099 countinghouse. Nobody.
03100 
03101 Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over
03102 on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a
03103 bit. Our prize titbit: _Matcham's Masterstroke_. Written by Mr Philip
03104 Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea
03105 a column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds
03106 three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.
03107 
03108 Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but
03109 resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he
03110 allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still
03111 patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's
03112 not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One
03113 tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch
03114 him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly
03115 season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat
03116 certainly. _Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the
03117 laughing witch who now_. Begins and ends morally. _Hand in hand_. Smart.
03118 He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water
03119 flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and
03120 received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.
03121 
03122 Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for
03123 some proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she
03124 said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting
03125 her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.l5.
03126 Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What
03127 possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that cabbage. A
03128 speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.
03129 
03130 Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning
03131 after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the
03132 hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
03133 night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head
03134 dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.
03135 Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use
03136 humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The
03137 mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
03138 vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.
03139 It wouldn't pan out somehow.
03140 
03141 Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers
03142 and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.
03143 Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.
03144 
03145 He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.
03146 Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled
03147 back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
03148 into the air.
03149 
03150 In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his
03151 black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time
03152 is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.
03153 
03154 A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's
03155 church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.
03156 
03157      _Heigho! Heigho!
03158      Heigho! Heigho!
03159      Heigho! Heigho!_
03160 
03161 
03162 Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air, third.
03163 
03164 Poor Dignam!
03165 
03166 
03167 By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
03168 Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.
03169 Could have given that address too. And past the sailors' home. He turned
03170 from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.
03171 By Brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal
03172 linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema
03173 on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell
03174 him if he smokes he won't grow. O let him! His life isn't such a bed of
03175 roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da.
03176 Slack hour: won't be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed
03177 the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past
03178 Nichols' the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny
03179 Kelleher bagged the job for O'Neill's. Singing with his eyes shut.
03180 Corny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark. Police tout.
03181 Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.
03182 O, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. With my
03183 tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.
03184 
03185 
03186 In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
03187 Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
03188 finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom
03189 Kernan. Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read
03190 blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his
03191 right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning.
03192 Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather
03193 headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down
03194 into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the
03195 headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.
03196 
03197 So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
03198 hair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
03199 blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it
03200 must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
03201 cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like
03202 that. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_,
03203 not doing a hand's turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot
03204 to quarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The
03205 air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants.
03206 Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on
03207 roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap
03208 I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his
03209 back, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn't sink if you tried: so
03210 thick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of
03211 the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the
03212 volume is equal to the weight? It's a law something like that. Vance in
03213 High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum.
03214 Cracking curriculum. What is weight really when you say the weight?
03215 Thirtytwo feet per second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second
03216 per second. They all fall to the ground. The earth. It's the force of
03217 gravity of the earth is the weight.
03218 
03219 He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her
03220 sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_
03221 from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and
03222 tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air:
03223 just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second for every second
03224 it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of
03225 the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.
03226 
03227 He handed the card through the brass grill.
03228 
03229 Are there any letters for me? he asked.
03230 
03231 While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
03232 poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his
03233 baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer
03234 probably. Went too far last time.
03235 
03236 The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a
03237 letter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.
03238 
03239 Henry Flower Esq, c/o P. O. Westland Row, City.
03240 
03241 Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,
03242 reviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where's old Tweedy's regiment?
03243 Castoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he's a
03244 grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats.
03245 Too showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to
03246 enlist and drill. Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell
03247 street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith's paper is on
03248 the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or
03249 halfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front.
03250 Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King's own. Never see him dressed
03251 up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.
03252 
03253 He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if
03254 that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
03255 felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.
03256 Women will pay a lot of heed, I don't think. His fingers drew forth the
03257 letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something
03258 pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.
03259 
03260 M'Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when
03261 you.
03262 
03263 Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?
03264 
03265 Hello, M'Coy. Nowhere in particular.
03266 
03267 How's the body?
03268 
03269 Fine. How are you?
03270 
03271 Just keeping alive, M'Coy said.
03272 
03273 His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
03274 
03275 Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you're...
03276 
03277 O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.
03278 
03279 To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?
03280 
03281 A photo it isn't. A badge maybe.
03282 
03283 E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.
03284 
03285 I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard
03286 it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?
03287 
03288 I know.
03289 
03290 Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
03291 of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She
03292 stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
03293 searched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll
03294 collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless
03295 stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty
03296 creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot.
03297 Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honourable
03298 Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take the starch
03299 out of her.
03300 
03301 I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do
03302 you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway's we were.
03303 
03304 Doran Lyons in Conway's. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came
03305 Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
03306 his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
03307 braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight
03308 perhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will
03309 she get up?
03310 
03311 And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I
03312 said. _Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.
03313 
03314 Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces
03315 dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for?
03316 Sees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two
03317 strings to her bow.
03318 
03319 Why?_ I said. _What's wrong with him?_ I said.
03320 
03321 Proud: rich: silk stockings.
03322 
03323 Yes, Mr Bloom said.
03324 
03325 He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. Getting up in a
03326 minute.
03327 
03328 What's wrong with him_? He said. _He's dead_, he said. And, faith,
03329 he filled up. _Is it Paddy Dignam_? I said. I couldn't believe it when I
03330 heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in
03331 the Arch. _Yes,_ he said. _He's gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow_.
03332 Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!
03333 
03334 A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.
03335 
03336 Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and
03337 the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace
03338 street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering
03339 the display of _esprit de corps_. Well, what are you gaping at?
03340 
03341 Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.
03342 
03343 One of the best, M'Coy said.
03344 
03345 The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
03346 gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her
03347 hat in the sun: flicker, flick.
03348 
03349 Wife well, I suppose? M'Coy's changed voice said.
03350 
03351 O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.
03352 
03353 He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
03354 
03355 What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat? Incomplete With it an
03356 abode of bliss._
03357 
03358 My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled yet.
03359 
03360 Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I'm off that, thanks.
03361 
03362 Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.
03363 
03364 My wife too, he said. She's going to sing at a swagger affair in the
03365 Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twenty-fifth.
03366 
03367 That so? M'Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who's getting it up?
03368 
03369 Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.
03370 No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady
03371 and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.
03372 
03373      _Love's
03374      Old
03375      Sweet
03376      Song
03377      Comes lo-ove's old..._
03378 
03379 It's a kind of a tour, don't you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.
03380 Sweeeet song_. There's a committee formed. Part shares and part
03381 profits.
03382 
03383 M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.
03384 
03385 O, well, he said. That's good news.
03386 
03387 He moved to go.
03388 
03389 Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.
03390 
03391 Yes, Mr Bloom said.
03392 
03393 Tell you what, M'Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,
03394 will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's a
03395 drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
03396 would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if
03397 I'm not there, will you?
03398 
03399 I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all right.
03400 
03401 Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly
03402 could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M'Coy will do.
03403 
03404 That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.
03405 
03406 Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I'd
03407 like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped
03408 corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him
03409 his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of
03410 it from that good day to this.
03411 
03412 Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just
03413 got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its
03414 way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don't you know:
03415 in the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can't
03416 he hear the difference? Think he's that way inclined a bit. Against
03417 my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that
03418 smallpox up there doesn't get worse. Suppose she wouldn't let herself be
03419 vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.
03420 
03421 Wonder is he pimping after me?
03422 
03423 Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
03424 hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery's Summer
03425 Sale. No, he's going on straight. Hello. _Leah_ tonight. Mrs Bandmann
03426 Palmer. Like to see her again in that. _Hamlet_ she played last night.
03427 Male impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed
03428 suicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside
03429 the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before
03430 I was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the
03431 right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was
03432 always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice
03433 and puts his fingers on his face.
03434 
03435 Nathan's voice! His son's voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his
03436 father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his
03437 father and left the God of his father.
03438 
03439 Every word is so deep, Leopold.
03440 
03441 Poor papa! Poor man! I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his
03442 face. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for
03443 him.
03444 
03445 Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
03446 hazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn't met
03447 that M'Coy fellow.
03448 
03449 He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing
03450 teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet
03451 oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they
03452 know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.
03453 Too full for words. Still they get their feed all right and their doss.
03454 Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their
03455 haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they
03456 look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.
03457 
03458 He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
03459 carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.
03460 
03461 He passed the cabman's shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies.
03462 All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. _Voglio
03463 e non_. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying
03464 syllables as they pass. He hummed:
03465 
03466      _La ci darem la mano
03467      La la lala la la._
03468 
03469 He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the
03470 lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade's timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins
03471 and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with
03472 its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted
03473 child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise
03474 tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb
03475 them. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it.
03476 And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame's school. She
03477 liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis's. And Mr? He opened the letter within the
03478 newspaper.
03479 
03480 A flower. I think it's a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not
03481 annoyed then? What does she say?
03482 
03483 Dear Henry
03484 
03485 I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry
03486 you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am
03487 awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called
03488 you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me
03489 what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home
03490 you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you.
03491 Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful
03492 name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often
03493 you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as
03494 you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me
03495 more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I
03496 will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to
03497 meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
03498 exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I
03499 have such a bad headache. today. and write _by return_ to your longing
03500 
03501 Martha
03502 
03503 P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to
03504 know.
03505 
03506 He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
03507 and placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it
03508 because no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then
03509 walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and
03510 there a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus
03511 if you don't please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses
03512 when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's perfume.
03513 Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his
03514 sidepocket.
03515 
03516 Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did she
03517 wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me,
03518 respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank
03519 you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners.
03520 Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go
03521 further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.
03522 Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.
03523 
03524 Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.
03525 Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:
03526 pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses
03527 without thorns.
03528 
03529 Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in the
03530 Coombe, linked together in the rain.
03531 
03532      _O, Mary lost the pin of her drawers.
03533      She didn't know what to do
03534      To keep it up
03535      To keep it up._
03536 
03537 It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all
03538 day typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your wife
03539 use. Now could you make out a thing like that?
03540 
03541      _To keep it up._
03542 
03543 Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
03544 faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also
03545 the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.
03546 
03547      _To keep it up._
03548 
03549 Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:
03550 quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been,
03551 strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper:
03552 fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole
03553 in the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the
03554 trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and
03555 more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.
03556 
03557 Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
03558 in shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered
03559 away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.
03560 
03561 Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the
03562 same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure
03563 cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be
03564 made out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change
03565 his shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A
03566 million pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,
03567 eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.
03568 One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions
03569 of barrels of porter.
03570 
03571 What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.
03572 
03573 An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.
03574 Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.
03575 The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
03576 together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
03577 pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.
03578 
03579 He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch
03580 he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again
03581 behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy
03582 for a pass to Mullingar.
03583 
03584 Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.J.
03585 on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the
03586 conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious. The
03587 protestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the true
03588 religion. Save China's millions. Wonder how they explain it to the
03589 heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for
03590 them. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy
03591 with hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo. Crown
03592 of thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. Chopsticks?
03593 Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking. Sorry I
03594 didn't work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that
03595 Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn't. They're taught that. He's
03596 not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise
03597 blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. Like to see
03598 them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Still
03599 life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.
03600 
03601 The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,
03602 pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.
03603 
03604 Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place
03605 to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow
03606 music. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the
03607 benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch
03608 knelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring,
03609 holding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a
03610 communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
03611 neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her hat
03612 sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent down
03613 to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one.
03614 Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? _Corpus:_ body. Corpse. Good
03615 idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They
03616 don't seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a
03617 corpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.
03618 
03619 He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
03620 one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in
03621 its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.
03622 We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here
03623 and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
03624 it to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that
03625 sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes
03626 them feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called.
03627 There's a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.
03628 First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family
03629 party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm sure of
03630 that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish.
03631 Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure,
03632 waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old
03633 fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith.
03634 Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next
03635 year.
03636 
03637 He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
03638 instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
03639 affair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn't know what
03640 to do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.
03641 Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have
03642 suffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.
03643 
03644 Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with
03645 a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here
03646 with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the
03647 sly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the
03648 invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion
03649 every morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am
03650 thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children
03651 at home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers,
03652 now that's a good name for them, there's always something shiftylooking
03653 about them. They're not straight men of business either. O, no, she's
03654 not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope?
03655 Yes: under the bridge.
03656 
03657 The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
03658 smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
03659 what they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage
03660 Wheatley's Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale
03661 aromatic). Doesn't give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.
03662 Cold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they'd have one old
03663 booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the
03664 whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.
03665 
03666 Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity.
03667 Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that
03668 instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in
03669 Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_
03670 of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or Pilate?
03671 Christ, but don't keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.
03672 Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice
03673 against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the
03674 people looking up:
03675 
03676 Quis est homo._
03677 
03678 Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.
03679 Mozart's twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that. Those old popes keen on music,
03680 on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example
03681 too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting,
03682 regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still,
03683 having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind
03684 of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.
03685 Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after. Kind of a
03686 placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don't they? Gluttons, tall, long
03687 legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.
03688 
03689 He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and
03690 bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom
03691 glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand
03692 up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again
03693 and he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the
03694 altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered
03695 each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a
03696 card:
03697 
03698 O God, our refuge and our strength...
03699 
03700 Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them
03701 the bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious
03702 and immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More
03703 interesting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful
03704 organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants
03705 to. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon
03706 in their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I
03707 schschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look
03708 down at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears.
03709 Husband learn to his surprise. God's little joke. Then out she comes.
03710 Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy
03711 Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation
03712 army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.
03713 How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they
03714 work the whole show. And don't they rake in the money too? Bequests
03715 also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion.
03716 Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.
03717 Monasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the
03718 witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.
03719 Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the
03720 church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.
03721 
03722 The priest prayed:
03723 
03724 Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be
03725 our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God
03726 restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly
03727 host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those
03728 other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.
03729 
03730 The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women
03731 remained behind: thanksgiving.
03732 
03733 Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate
03734 perhaps. Pay your Easter duty.
03735 
03736 He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the
03737 time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there's a
03738 whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.
03739 Glimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don't. Why didn't you tell me
03740 before. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn't farther south.
03741 He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main
03742 door into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble
03743 bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in
03744 the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott's dyeworks: a widow
03745 in her weeds. Notice because I'm in mourning myself. He covered himself.
03746 How goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion
03747 made up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny's in Lincoln place.
03748 Chemists rarely move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.
03749 Hamilton Long's, founded in the year of the flood. Huguenot churchyard
03750 near there. Visit some day.
03751 
03752 He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other
03753 trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair.
03754 O well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. When was it I got it made up
03755 last? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must
03756 have been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.
03757 
03758 The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems
03759 to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's stone. The
03760 alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then. Why?
03761 Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character.
03762 Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his
03763 alabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid.
03764 Smell almost cure you like the dentist's doorbell. Doctor Whack. He
03765 ought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow
03766 that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to
03767 be careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns blue
03768 litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts.
03769 Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or the
03770 phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it. Clever
03771 of nature.
03772 
03773 About a fortnight ago, sir?
03774 
03775 Yes, Mr Bloom said.
03776 
03777 He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
03778 dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling
03779 your aches and pains.
03780 
03781 Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
03782 orangeflower water...
03783 
03784 It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.
03785 
03786 And white wax also, he said.
03787 
03788 Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to
03789 her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my
03790 cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the
03791 teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.
03792 Skinfood. One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only
03793 one skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to
03794 make it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? _Peau
03795 d'Espagne_. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps
03796 have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam.
03797 Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice
03798 girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing
03799 I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for
03800 massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.
03801 
03802 Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a
03803 bottle?
03804 
03805 No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day and
03806 I'll take one of these soaps. How much are they?
03807 
03808 Fourpence, sir.
03809 
03810 Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.
03811 
03812 I'll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.
03813 
03814 Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you
03815 come back.
03816 
03817 Good, Mr Bloom said.
03818 
03819 He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
03820 coolwrappered soap in his left hand.
03821 
03822 At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said:
03823 
03824 Hello, Bloom. What's the best news? Is that today's? Show us a minute.
03825 
03826 Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look
03827 younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.
03828 
03829 Bantam Lyons's yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a
03830 wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears'
03831 soap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.
03832 
03833 I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam
03834 Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?
03835 
03836 He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.
03837 Barber's itch. Tight collar he'll lose his hair. Better leave him the
03838 paper and get shut of him.
03839 
03840 You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.
03841 
03842 Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the
03843 second.
03844 
03845 I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.
03846 
03847 Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.
03848 
03849 What's that? his sharp voice said.
03850 
03851 I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away
03852 that moment.
03853 
03854 Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
03855 sheets back on Mr Bloom's arms.
03856 
03857 I'll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.
03858 
03859 He sped off towards Conway's corner. God speed scut.
03860 
03861 Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
03862 in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it
03863 lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large
03864 tender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming
03865 embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now.
03866 They never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.
03867 
03868 He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a
03869 mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He
03870 eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled
03871 up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round
03872 like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big:
03873 college. Something to catch the eye.
03874 
03875 There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. Keep him on hands:
03876 might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How
03877 do you do, sir?
03878 
03879 Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.
03880 Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can't play it
03881 here. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the
03882 Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more
03883 in their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the
03884 floor. Heatwave. Won't last. Always passing, the stream of life, which
03885 in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.
03886 
03887 Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
03888 stream. This is my body.
03889 
03890 He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
03891 warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his
03892 trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
03893 lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
03894 his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of
03895 thousands, a languid floating flower.
03896 
03897 
03898 
03899 Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
03900 carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after
03901 him, curving his height with care.
03902 
03903 Come on, Simon.
03904 
03905 After you, Mr Bloom said.
03906 
03907 Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
03908 
03909 Yes, yes.
03910 
03911 Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.
03912 
03913 Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to
03914 after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm
03915 through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow
03916 at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman
03917 peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she
03918 was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad
03919 to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.
03920 Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd
03921 wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making
03922 the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who
03923 will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and
03924 the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean
03925 job.
03926 
03927 All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am
03928 sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift
03929 it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.
03930 
03931 All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
03932 then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and
03933 swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of
03934 the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At
03935 walking pace.
03936 
03937 They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
03938 passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels
03939 rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
03940 rattling in the doorframes.
03941 
03942 What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.
03943 
03944 Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.
03945 
03946 Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.
03947 
03948 That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died
03949 out.
03950 
03951 All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
03952 passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
03953 smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
03954 clad in mourning, a wide hat.
03955 
03956 There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.
03957 
03958 Who is that?
03959 
03960 Your son and heir.
03961 
03962 Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.
03963 
03964 The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
03965 before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
03966 to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus
03967 fell back, saying:
03968 
03969 Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!
03970 
03971 No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.
03972 
03973 Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
03974 faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump
03975 of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.
03976 
03977 Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the
03978 bottleworks: Dodder bridge.
03979 
03980 Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
03981 the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing
03982 in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
03983 landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.
03984 Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing
03985 his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are.
03986 About six hundred per cent profit.
03987 
03988 He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a
03989 contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks
03990 all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll
03991 make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
03992 or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.
03993 I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.
03994 
03995 He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
03996 
03997 I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's
03998 son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.
03999 
04000 He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild
04001 face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
04002 selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If
04003 little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.
04004 Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange
04005 feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning
04006 in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by
04007 the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had
04008 that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch,
04009 Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.
04010 
04011 Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.
04012 I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn
04013 German too.
04014 
04015 Are we late? Mr Power asked.
04016 
04017 Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.
04018 
04019 Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping
04020 Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a
04021 woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.
04022 Life, life.
04023 
04024 The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.
04025 
04026 Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.
04027 
04028 He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do
04029 you follow me?
04030 
04031 He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away
04032 crustcrumbs from under his thighs.
04033 
04034 What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?
04035 
04036 Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
04037 said.
04038 
04039 All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
04040 leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
04041 and said:
04042 
04043 Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
04044 
04045 It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.
04046 
04047 Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
04048 clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.
04049 
04050 Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.
04051 
04052 After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.
04053 
04054 Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
04055 his beard gently.
04056 
04057 Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.
04058 
04059 And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.
04060 
04061 At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.
04062 
04063 I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.
04064 
04065 The carriage halted short.
04066 
04067 What's wrong?
04068 
04069 We're stopped.
04070 
04071 Where are we?
04072 
04073 Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.
04074 
04075 The grand canal, he said.
04076 
04077 Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got
04078 it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame
04079 really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed
04080 tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss
04081 this chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,
04082 Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.
04083 A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's
04084 dogs usually are.
04085 
04086 A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower
04087 spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander.
04088 I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.
04089 
04090 The weather is changing, he said quietly.
04091 
04092 A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.
04093 
04094 Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming
04095 out.
04096 
04097 Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a
04098 mute curse at the sky.
04099 
04100 It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.
04101 
04102 We're off again.
04103 
04104 The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
04105 gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
04106 
04107 Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking
04108 him off to his face.
04109 
04110 O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear
04111 him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of _The Croppy Boy_.
04112 
04113 Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. _His singing of that simple
04114 ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
04115 whole course of my experience._
04116 
04117 Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the
04118 retrospective arrangement.
04119 
04120 Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.
04121 
04122 I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?
04123 
04124 In the paper this morning.
04125 
04126 Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change
04127 for her.
04128 
04129 No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.
04130 
04131 Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
04132 deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
04133 Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton,
04134 Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.
04135 Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of
04136 his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind: Quinlan. On
04137 whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.
04138 
04139 It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky
04140 While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him
04141 on high._
04142 
04143 I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it
04144 in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry
04145 fled. Before my patience are exhausted.
04146 
04147 National school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.
04148 Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round
04149 with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their
04150 hats.
04151 
04152 A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
04153 tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something
04154 automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow
04155 would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job
04156 making the new invention?
04157 
04158 Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a
04159 crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law
04160 perhaps.
04161 
04162 They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway
04163 bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene
04164 Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder.
04165 I said I. Or the _Lily of Killarney_? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big
04166 powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. _Fun on the Bristol_.
04167 Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a
04168 drink or two. As broad as it's long.
04169 
04170 He's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.
04171 
04172 Plasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?
04173 
04174 How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
04175 salute.
04176 
04177 He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?
04178 
04179 Who? Mr Dedalus asked.
04180 
04181 Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.
04182 
04183 Just that moment I was thinking.
04184 
04185 Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the
04186 white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.
04187 
04188 Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
04189 hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
04190 Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes
04191 feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I
04192 am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body
04193 getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes
04194 that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh
04195 falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.
04196 Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks
04197 behind.
04198 
04199 He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
04200 glance over their faces.
04201 
04202 Mr Power asked:
04203 
04204 How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?
04205 
04206 O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good
04207 idea, you see...
04208 
04209 Are you going yourself?
04210 
04211 Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the
04212 county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the
04213 chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.
04214 
04215 Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.
04216 
04217 Have you good artists?
04218 
04219 Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all
04220 topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in
04221 fact.
04222 
04223 And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.
04224 
04225 Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped
04226 them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman.
04227 Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by
04228 Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.
04229 
04230 Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
04231 mouth opening: oot.
04232 
04233 Four bootlaces for a penny.
04234 
04235 Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.
04236 Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.
04237 Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.
04238 Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.
04239 O'Callaghan on his last legs.
04240 
04241 And _Madame_. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing
04242 her hair, humming. _voglio e non vorrei_. No. _vorrei e non_. Looking at
04243 the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. _Mi trema un poco
04244 il_. Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A
04245 throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.
04246 
04247 His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over
04248 the ears. _Madame_: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.
04249 Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the
04250 woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it
04251 told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played
04252 out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her
04253 a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the
04254 Moira, was it?
04255 
04256 They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.
04257 
04258 Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.
04259 
04260 Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.
04261 
04262 A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
04263 of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.
04264 
04265 In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.
04266 
04267 Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
04268 
04269 The devil break the hasp of your back!
04270 
04271 Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the
04272 carriage passed Gray's statue.
04273 
04274 We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.
04275 
04276 His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:
04277 
04278 Well, nearly all of us.
04279 
04280 Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.
04281 
04282 That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and
04283 the son.
04284 
04285 About the boatman? Mr Power asked.
04286 
04287 Yes. Isn't it awfully good?
04288 
04289 What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.
04290 
04291 There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
04292 send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both
04293 
04294 
04295 What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?
04296 
04297 Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
04298 to drown...
04299 
04300 Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!
04301 
04302 Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.
04303 
04304 No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself...
04305 
04306 Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
04307 
04308 Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
04309 their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
04310 loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
04311 
04312 For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?
04313 
04314 Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
04315 him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
04316 on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.
04317 
04318 Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...
04319 
04320 And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
04321 saving his son's life.
04322 
04323 A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.
04324 
04325 O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.
04326 
04327 Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.
04328 
04329 One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
04330 
04331 Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.
04332 
04333 Nelson's pillar.
04334 
04335 Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
04336 
04337 We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.
04338 
04339 Mr Dedalus sighed.
04340 
04341 Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh.
04342 Many a good one he told himself.
04343 
04344 The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
04345 fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and
04346 he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's
04347 gone from us.
04348 
04349 As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went
04350 very suddenly.
04351 
04352 Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.
04353 
04354 He tapped his chest sadly.
04355 
04356 Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.
04357 Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent
04358 colouring it.
04359 
04360 Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.
04361 
04362 He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.
04363 
04364 The best death, Mr Bloom said.
04365 
04366 Their wide open eyes looked at him.
04367 
04368 No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.
04369 
04370 No-one spoke.
04371 
04372 Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,
04373 temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college,
04374 Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or
04375 wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the
04376 late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.
04377 
04378 White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,
04379 galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning
04380 coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for
04381 a nun.
04382 
04383 Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.
04384 
04385 A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body,
04386 weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society
04387 pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant
04388 nothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not
04389 from the man. Better luck next time.
04390 
04391 Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.
04392 
04393 The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his
04394 bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.
04395 
04396 In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.
04397 
04398 But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
04399 life.
04400 
04401 Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.
04402 
04403 The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.
04404 
04405 Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We
04406 must take a charitable view of it.
04407 
04408 They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.
04409 
04410 It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.
04411 
04412 Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's
04413 large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.
04414 Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy
04415 on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive
04416 a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken
04417 already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed
04418 clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife
04419 of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the
04420 furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the
04421 damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start
04422 afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight
04423 that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and
04424 capering with Martin's umbrella.
04425 
04426      _And they call me the jewel of Asia,
04427      Of Asia,
04428      The Geisha._
04429 
04430 He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.
04431 
04432 That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The
04433 room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through
04434 the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big and
04435 hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like
04436 yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.
04437 Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son
04438 Leopold.
04439 
04440 No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.
04441 
04442 The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.
04443 
04444 We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.
04445 
04446 God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.
04447 
04448 I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow
04449 in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.
04450 
04451 Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.
04452 
04453 As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent
04454 over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody
04455 here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from _Saul._ He's
04456 as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The _Mater
04457 Misericordiae_. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for
04458 incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying.
04459 Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look
04460 terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the
04461 spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student
04462 that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the
04463 lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The
04464 carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.
04465 
04466 What's wrong now?
04467 
04468 A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
04469 by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
04470 croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their
04471 fear.
04472 
04473 Emigrants, Mr Power said.
04474 
04475 Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.
04476 
04477 Huuuh! out of that!
04478 
04479 Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them
04480 about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old
04481 England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter
04482 lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a
04483 year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,
04484 soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off
04485 the train at Clonsilla.
04486 
04487 The carriage moved on through the drove.
04488 
04489 I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the
04490 parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken
04491 in trucks down to the boats.
04492 
04493 Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite
04494 right. They ought to.
04495 
04496 Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
04497 municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line
04498 out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
04499 and all. Don't you see what I mean?
04500 
04501 O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon
04502 diningroom.
04503 
04504 A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.
04505 
04506 Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent
04507 than galloping two abreast?
04508 
04509 Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.
04510 
04511 And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when
04512 the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.
04513 
04514 That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell
04515 about the road. Terrible!
04516 
04517 First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.
04518 
04519 Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.
04520 
04521 Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam
04522 shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large
04523 for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now.
04524 Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose
04525 quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax.
04526 The sphincter loose. Seal up all.
04527 
04528 Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.
04529 
04530 Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A
04531 pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up
04532 here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.
04533 Elixir of life.
04534 
04535 But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him
04536 in the knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on
04537 where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It
04538 would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.
04539 
04540 In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted
04541 by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.
04542 
04543 Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.
04544 
04545 Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his
04546 dropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a
04547 slacktethered horse. Aboard of the _Bugabu._
04548 
04549 Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his
04550 raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
04551 reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,
04552 Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or
04553 cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at
04554 the auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby
04555 to row me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.
04556 Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without
04557 writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by
04558 lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his
04559 brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.
04560 
04561 They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.
04562 
04563 I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.
04564 
04565 Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.
04566 
04567 How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?
04568 
04569 Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.
04570 
04571 The carriage steered left for Finglas road.
04572 
04573 The stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of
04574 land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
04575 knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:
04576 appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and
04577 sculptor.
04578 
04579 Passed.
04580 
04581 On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat,
04582 grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
04583 yawning boot. After life's journey.
04584 
04585 Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.
04586 
04587 Mr Power pointed.
04588 
04589 That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.
04590 
04591 So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.
04592 Murdered his brother. Or so they said.
04593 
04594 The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.
04595 
04596 Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of the
04597 law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person
04598 to be wrongfully condemned.
04599 
04600 They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless,
04601 unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder.
04602 The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about
04603 it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met
04604 her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large.
04605 Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.
04606 
04607 Cramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without
04608 letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with
04609 their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.
04610 
04611 The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,
04612 rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
04613 trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain
04614 gestures on the air.
04615 
04616 The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put
04617 out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
04618 his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.
04619 
04620 Change that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
04621 and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.
04622 He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
04623 still held.
04624 
04625 Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same.
04626 Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.
04627 Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and
04628 fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.
04629 Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.
04630 
04631 He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
04632 walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
04633 out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.
04634 
04635 Where is that child's funeral disappeared to?
04636 
04637 A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
04638 dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
04639 granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.
04640 
04641 Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it
04642 with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing
04643 on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here
04644 every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount
04645 Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every
04646 minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands
04647 every hour. Too many in the world.
04648 
04649 Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,
04650 hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt
04651 and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.
04652 Fish's face, bloodless and livid.
04653 
04654 The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So
04655 much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First
04656 the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the
04657 boy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the
04658 brother-in-law.
04659 
04660 All walked after.
04661 
04662 Martin Cunningham whispered:
04663 
04664 I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.
04665 
04666 What? Mr Power whispered. How so?
04667 
04668 His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the
04669 Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.
04670 Anniversary.
04671 
04672 O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?
04673 
04674 He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
04675 towards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.
04676 
04677 Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.
04678 
04679 I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily
04680 mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.
04681 
04682 How many children did he leave?
04683 
04684 Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.
04685 
04686 A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.
04687 
04688 A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.
04689 
04690 Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.
04691 
04692 Has the laugh at him now.
04693 
04694 He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had
04695 outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must
04696 outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the
04697 world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow
04698 him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who
04699 knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on
04700 a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But
04701 in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of
04702 hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the
04703 substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
04704 waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and
04705 lie no more in her warm bed.
04706 
04707 How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't
04708 seen you for a month of Sundays.
04709 
04710 Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?
04711 
04712 I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
04713 said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.
04714 
04715 And how is Dick, the solid man?
04716 
04717 Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.
04718 
04719 By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?
04720 
04721 Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
04722 pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the
04723 insurance is cleared up.
04724 
04725 Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
04726 
04727 Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is
04728 behind. He put down his name for a quid.
04729 
04730 I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought
04731 to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.
04732 
04733 How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?
04734 
04735 Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.
04736 
04737 They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind
04738 the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the
04739 slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there
04740 when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment
04741 and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three
04742 shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin
04743 into the chapel. Which end is his head?
04744 
04745 After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
04746 light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
04747 candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a
04748 wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners
04749 knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the
04750 font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
04751 from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black
04752 hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.
04753 
04754 A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
04755 door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one
04756 hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly.
04757 Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.
04758 
04759 They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
04760 with a fluent croak.
04761 
04762 Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. _Domine-namine._ Bully
04763 about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe
04764 betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst
04765 sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on
04766 him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:
04767 burst sideways.
04768 
04769 Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._
04770 
04771 Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass.
04772 Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly
04773 place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the
04774 gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too.
04775 What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of
04776 the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot
04777 of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw
04778 beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of
04779 saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a
04780 hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it
04781 rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.
04782 
04783 My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.
04784 
04785 The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's
04786 bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and
04787 shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you
04788 were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.
04789 
04790 Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._
04791 
04792 The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
04793 better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course
04794 
04795 
04796 Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed
04797 up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.
04798 What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal
04799 day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
04800 childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
04801 with little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same
04802 thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam
04803 now.
04804 
04805 In paradisum._
04806 
04807 Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over
04808 everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.
04809 
04810 The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny
04811 Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
04812 coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher
04813 gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed
04814 them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last
04815 folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground
04816 till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the
04817 gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the
04818 trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.
04819 
04820 The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.
04821 
04822 The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.
04823 
04824 Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.
04825 
04826 He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But
04827 his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here,
04828 Simon!
04829 
04830 Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be stretched
04831 beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.
04832 
04833 Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
04834 in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.
04835 
04836 She's better where she is, he said kindly.
04837 
04838 I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in
04839 heaven if there is a heaven.
04840 
04841 Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
04842 plod by.
04843 
04844 Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.
04845 
04846 Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.
04847 
04848 The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can
04849 do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.
04850 
04851 They covered their heads.
04852 
04853 The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think?
04854 Mr Kernan said with reproof.
04855 
04856 Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret
04857 eyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We
04858 are the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.
04859 
04860 Mr Kernan added:
04861 
04862 The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
04863 impressive I must say.
04864 
04865 Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.
04866 
04867 Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
04868 
04869 I am the resurrection and the life_. That touches a man's inmost
04870 heart.
04871 
04872 It does, Mr Bloom said.
04873 
04874 Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
04875 with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.
04876 Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
04877 every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of
04878 them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn
04879 the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are
04880 dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come
04881 forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day!
04882 Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the
04883 rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of
04884 powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.
04885 
04886 Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.
04887 
04888 Everything went off A1, he said. What?
04889 
04890 He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With
04891 your tooraloom tooraloom.
04892 
04893 As it should be, Mr Kernan said.
04894 
04895 What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.
04896 
04897 Mr Kernan assured him.
04898 
04899 Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I
04900 know his face.
04901 
04902 Ned Lambert glanced back.
04903 
04904 Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
04905 soprano. She's his wife.
04906 
04907 O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some
04908 time. He was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen
04909 seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good
04910 armful she was.
04911 
04912 He looked behind through the others.
04913 
04914 What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery
04915 line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.
04916 
04917 Ned Lambert smiled.
04918 
04919 Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.
04920 
04921 In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
04922 that for? She had plenty of game in her then.
04923 
04924 Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.
04925 
04926 John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.
04927 
04928 The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
04929 grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.
04930 
04931 John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.
04932 
04933 Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:
04934 
04935 I am come to pay you another visit.
04936 
04937 My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want
04938 your custom at all.
04939 
04940 Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
04941 Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.
04942 
04943 Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?
04944 
04945 I did not, Martin Cunningham said.
04946 
04947 They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
04948 caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
04949 in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.
04950 
04951 They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
04952 evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for
04953 Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After
04954 traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the
04955 drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking
04956 up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.
04957 
04958 The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He
04959 resumed:
04960 
04961 And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like
04962 the man_, says he. _That's not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.
04963 
04964 Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting
04965 the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.
04966 
04967 That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.
04968 
04969 I know, Hynes said. I know that.
04970 
04971 To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure
04972 goodheartedness: damn the thing else.
04973 
04974 Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on good
04975 terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. Keys:
04976 like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks.
04977 Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I
04978 write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me
04979 writing to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. Be
04980 the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's the first sign when
04981 the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among
04982 the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to
04983 any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It
04984 might thrill her first. Courting death... Shades of night hovering
04985 here with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when
04986 churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose
04987 who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the
04988 same like a big giant in the dark. Will o' the wisp. Gas of graves.
04989 Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so
04990 touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever
04991 seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on
04992 the stroke of twelve. Still they'd kiss all right if properly keyed up.
04993 Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might
04994 pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones.
04995 Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both
04996 ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to
04997 the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting
04998 to do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.
04999 
05000 He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
05001 after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.
05002 Sitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some
05003 day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed
05004 the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim
05005 grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well,
05006 so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant
05007 poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic
05008 Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives
05009 new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every
05010 man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable
05011 for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor
05012 and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With
05013 thanks.
05014 
05015 I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
05016 nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot
05017 quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy
05018 kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of
05019 them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they
05020 are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to
05021 feed on feed on themselves.
05022 
05023 But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply
05024 swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little
05025 seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of
05026 power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life.
05027 Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about
05028 the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m.
05029 closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men
05030 anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in
05031 fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep
05032 out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.
05033 Gravediggers in _Hamlet_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human
05034 heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. _De mortuis
05035 nil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.
05036 Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live
05037 longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.
05038 
05039 How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.
05040 
05041 Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.
05042 
05043 The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
05044 trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping
05045 with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its
05046 nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.
05047 
05048 Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He
05049 doesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot
05050 over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd
05051 give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never
05052 dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he
05053 could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he
05054 could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First
05055 thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to
05056 life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you
05057 come to look at it.
05058 
05059      _O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
05060      How could you possibly do so?_
05061 
05062 Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of
05063 them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could
05064 invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that
05065 way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's.
05066 They're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from
05067 the holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
05068 coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible
05069 even in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in
05070 catacombs, mummies the same idea.
05071 
05072 Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
05073 Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's
05074 number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that
05075 I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.
05076 
05077 Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had
05078 one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was
05079 once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit
05080 of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's not
05081 married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.
05082 
05083 The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
05084 gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.
05085 
05086 Pause.
05087 
05088 If we were all suddenly somebody else.
05089 
05090 Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they
05091 say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.
05092 
05093 Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The
05094 boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
05095 the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.
05096 Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.
05097 Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must be
05098 damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone
05099 else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then
05100 darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you
05101 like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid
05102 all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his
05103 lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the
05104 soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the
05105 floor since he's doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing
05106 him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of _Lucia.
05107 Shall i nevermore behold thee_? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People
05108 talk about you a bit: forget you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember
05109 him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow:
05110 dropping into a hole, one after the other.
05111 
05112 We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and
05113 not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the
05114 fire of purgatory.
05115 
05116 Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when
05117 you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning. Near
05118 you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor
05119 mamma, and little Rudy.
05120 
05121 The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
05122 on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all
05123 the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of
05124 course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have
05125 some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or
05126 a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of
05127 distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well
05128 to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.
05129 
05130 The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.
05131 
05132 The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of
05133 it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
05134 without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its
05135 way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he
05136 traversed the dismal fields.
05137 
05138 Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he
05139 knows them all. No: coming to me.
05140 
05141 I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your
05142 christian name? I'm not sure.
05143 
05144 L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He
05145 asked me to.
05146 
05147 Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the _Freeman_ once.
05148 
05149 So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good
05150 idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know.
05151 He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.
05152 Charley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does
05153 no harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him
05154 under an obligation: costs nothing.
05155 
05156 And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
05157 over there in the...
05158 
05159 He looked around.
05160 
05161 Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
05162 
05163 M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his
05164 name?
05165 
05166 He moved away, looking about him.
05167 
05168 No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!
05169 
05170 Didn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all
05171 the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good
05172 Lord, what became of him?
05173 
05174 A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.
05175 
05176 O, excuse me!
05177 
05178 He stepped aside nimbly.
05179 
05180 Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.
05181 A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their
05182 spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped
05183 his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The
05184 gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
05185 the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent
05186 to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates,
05187 walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.
05188 Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.
05189 The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
05190 Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For
05191 yourselves just.
05192 
05193 The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at
05194 whiles to read a name on a tomb.
05195 
05196 Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.
05197 
05198 Let us, Mr Power said.
05199 
05200 They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr
05201 Power's blank voice spoke:
05202 
05203 Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled
05204 with stones. That one day he will come again.
05205 
05206 Hynes shook his head.
05207 
05208 Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was
05209 mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.
05210 
05211 Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
05212 broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
05213 old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some
05214 charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody
05215 really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then
05216 lump them together to save time. All souls' day. Twentyseventh I'll be
05217 at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds.
05218 Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's
05219 door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of
05220 their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the
05221 bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So,
05222 wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the
05223 pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew.
05224 Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it
05225 Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it.
05226 Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him home. Well it's God's
05227 acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted.
05228 Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church Times._ Marriage
05229 ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of
05230 bronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more
05231 poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses
05232 nothing. Immortelles.
05233 
05234 A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the
05235 wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.
05236 Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.
05237 Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a
05238 daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.
05239 
05240 The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be
05241 sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was
05242 dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this
05243 infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
05244 of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the
05245 boy. Apollo that was.
05246 
05247 How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As
05248 you are now so once were we.
05249 
05250 Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the
05251 voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
05252 the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.
05253 Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain
05254 hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph
05255 reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after
05256 fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died
05257 when I was in Wisdom Hely's.
05258 
05259 Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!
05260 
05261 He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he
05262 goes.
05263 
05264 An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
05265 pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey
05266 alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.
05267 Good hidingplace for treasure.
05268 
05269 Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was
05270 buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.
05271 
05272 Tail gone now.
05273 
05274 One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones
05275 clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat
05276 gone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that
05277 Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
05278 corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the
05279 other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the
05280 plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes.
05281 Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds.
05282 Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole
05283 life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't bury in the
05284 air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about
05285 whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned
05286 that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed for them.
05287 Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn't care
05288 about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste
05289 like raw white turnips.
05290 
05291 The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.
05292 Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I
05293 was here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.
05294 And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case
05295 I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
05296 gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after
05297 death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after
05298 death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that
05299 other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel
05300 yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty
05301 beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm
05302 fullblooded life.
05303 
05304 Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.
05305 
05306 Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
05307 commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.
05308 Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars,
05309 the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out
05310 that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke
05311 of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate
05312 at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree,
05313 laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.
05314 
05315 Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.
05316 
05317 Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.
05318 
05319 They stopped.
05320 
05321 Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.
05322 
05323 John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.
05324 
05325 There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton took
05326 off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his
05327 coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.
05328 
05329 It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.
05330 
05331 John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.
05332 
05333 Thank you, he said shortly.
05334 
05335 They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind
05336 a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin
05337 could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his
05338 seeing it.
05339 
05340 Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.
05341 Get the pull over him that way.
05342 
05343 Thank you. How grand we are this morning!
05344 
05345 
05346 IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS
05347 
05348 
05349 Before Nelson's pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started
05350 for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,
05351 Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,
05352 Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold's Cross. The hoarse Dublin United
05353 Tramway Company's timekeeper bawled them off:
05354 
05355 Rathgar and Terenure!
05356 
05357 Come on, Sandymount Green!
05358 
05359 Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck
05360 moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.
05361 
05362 Start, Palmerston Park!
05363 
05364 
05365 THE WEARER OF THE CROWN
05366 
05367 
05368 Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and
05369 polished. Parked in North Prince's street His Majesty's vermilion
05370 mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received
05371 loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured
05372 and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.
05373 
05374 GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS
05375 
05376 
05377 Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince's stores
05378 and bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped
05379 dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince's
05380 stores.
05381 
05382 There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.
05383 
05384 Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I'll take it round to
05385 the _Telegraph_ office.
05386 
05387 The door of Ruttledge's office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in a
05388 large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with
05389 a roll of papers under his cape, a king's courier.
05390 
05391 Red Murray's long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper
05392 in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.
05393 
05394 I'll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut
05395 square.
05396 
05397 Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind
05398 his ear, we can do him one.
05399 
05400 Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I'll rub that in.
05401 
05402 We.
05403 
05404 WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT
05405 
05406 
05407 Red Murray touched Mr Bloom's arm with the shears and whispered:
05408 
05409 Brayden.
05410 
05411 Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a
05412 stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman
05413 and National Press_ and the _Freeman's Journal and National Press_.
05414 Dullthudding Guinness's barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase,
05415 steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back
05416 ascended each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck,
05417 Simon Dedalus says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck,
05418 fat, neck, fat, neck.
05419 
05420 Don't you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.
05421 
05422 The door of Ruttledge's office whispered: ee: cree. They always build
05423 one door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.
05424 
05425 Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.
05426 Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.
05427 
05428 Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.
05429 
05430 Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our
05431 Saviour.
05432 
05433 Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on his
05434 heart. In _Martha._
05435 
05436      _Co-ome thou lost one,
05437      Co-ome thou dear one!_
05438 
05439 THE CROZIER AND THE PEN
05440 
05441 
05442 His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.
05443 
05444 They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.
05445 
05446 A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and
05447 stepped off posthaste with a word:
05448 
05449 Freeman!_
05450 
05451 Mr Bloom said slowly:
05452 
05453 Well, he is one of our saviours also.
05454 
05455 A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed
05456 in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage,
05457 along the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?
05458 Thumping. Thumping.
05459 
05460 He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn
05461 packing paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards
05462 Nannetti's reading closet.
05463 
05464 WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST
05465 RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS
05466 
05467 
05468 Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump. This
05469 morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man
05470 to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His machineries
05471 are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working
05472 away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.
05473 
05474 HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT
05475 
05476 
05477 Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman's spare body, admiring a glossy
05478 crown.
05479 
05480 Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for
05481 College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth.
05482 It's the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the
05483 official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year
05484 one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony
05485 of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute
05486 showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina.
05487 Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake's weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle
05488 Toby's page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin's queries. Dear Mr Editor,
05489 what is a good cure for flatulence? I'd like that part. Learn a lot
05490 teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures.
05491 Shapely bathers on golden strand. World's biggest balloon. Double
05492 marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at
05493 each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.
05494 
05495 The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he
05496 got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they'd clank on and
05497 on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the
05498 whole thing. Want a cool head.
05499 
05500 Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.
05501 
05502 Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.
05503 
05504 The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet
05505 and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the
05506 dirty glass screen.
05507 
05508 Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.
05509 
05510 Mr Bloom stood in his way.
05511 
05512 If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,
05513 pointing backward with his thumb.
05514 
05515 Did you? Hynes asked.
05516 
05517 Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you'll catch him.
05518 
05519 Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I'll tap him too.
05520 
05521 He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman's Journal_.
05522 
05523 Three bob I lent him in Meagher's. Three weeks. Third hint.
05524 
05525 WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK
05526 
05527 
05528 Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti's desk.
05529 
05530 Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?
05531 
05532 Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.
05533 
05534 He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.
05535 
05536 The foreman moved his pencil towards it.
05537 
05538 But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants
05539 two keys at the top.
05540 
05541 Hell of a racket they make. He doesn't hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.
05542 Maybe he understands what I.
05543 
05544 The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began
05545 to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.
05546 
05547 Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.
05548 
05549 Let him take that in first.
05550 
05551 Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
05552 foreman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
05553 obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles
05554 of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels:
05555 various uses, thousand and one things.
05556 
05557 Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew
05558 swiftly on the scarred woodwork.
05559 
05560 HOUSE OF KEY(E)S
05561 
05562 
05563 Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.
05564 Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.
05565 
05566 Better not teach him his own business.
05567 
05568 You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top
05569 in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that's a good idea?
05570 
05571 The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched
05572 there quietly.
05573 
05574 The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,
05575 the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the
05576 isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?
05577 
05578 I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then
05579 if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.
05580 
05581 We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?
05582 
05583 I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a
05584 house there too. I'll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that
05585 and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass
05586 licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.
05587 
05588 The foreman thought for an instant.
05589 
05590 We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months' renewal.
05591 
05592 A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it
05593 silently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching
05594 the silent typesetters at their cases.
05595 
05596 ORTHOGRAPHICAL
05597 
05598 
05599 Want to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot
05600 to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to view
05601 the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of a
05602 harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear
05603 under a cemetery wall. Silly, isn't it? Cemetery put in of course on
05604 account of the symmetry.
05605 
05606 I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought
05607 to have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have
05608 said. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.
05609 
05610 Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its
05611 flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost
05612 human the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak.
05613 That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its
05614 own way. Sllt.
05615 
05616 NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR
05617 
05618 
05619 The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:
05620 
05621 Wait. Where's the archbishop's letter? It's to be repeated in the
05622 Telegraph._ Where's what's his name?
05623 
05624 He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.
05625 
05626 Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.
05627 
05628 Ay. Where's Monks?
05629 
05630 Monks!
05631 
05632 Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.
05633 
05634 Then I'll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you'll give it a
05635 good place I know.
05636 
05637 Monks!
05638 
05639 Yes, sir.
05640 
05641 Three months' renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it
05642 anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge. Tourists
05643 over for the show.
05644 
05645 A DAYFATHER
05646 
05647 
05648 He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled,
05649 aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put
05650 through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs' ads, speeches,
05651 divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober
05652 serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I'd say. Wife a good cook and
05653 washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn
05654 nonsense. AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER
05655 
05656 
05657 He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.
05658 Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice
05659 that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards
05660 with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear!
05661 All that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt
05662 and into the house of bondage _Alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu_.
05663 No, that's the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons. And then
05664 the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the
05665 butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the
05666 ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look
05667 into it well. Justice it means but it's everybody eating everyone else.
05668 That's what life is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice
05669 makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.
05670 
05671 Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to
05672 the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch
05673 him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as
05674 Citron's house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.
05675 
05676 ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP
05677 
05678 
05679 He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those
05680 walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy
05681 smell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom's next door
05682 when I was there.
05683 
05684 He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap
05685 I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief
05686 he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket
05687 of his trousers.
05688 
05689 What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something
05690 I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.
05691 
05692 A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.
05693 Know who that is. What's up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it
05694 is.
05695 
05696 He entered softly.
05697 
05698 ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA
05699 
05700 
05701 The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to
05702 the dusty windowpane.
05703 
05704 Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert's quizzing
05705 face, asked of it sourly:
05706 
05707 Agonising Christ, wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse?
05708 
05709 Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
05710 
05711 Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles
05712 on its way, tho' quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling
05713 waters of Neptune's blue domain, 'mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest
05714 zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or 'neath the shadows cast
05715 o'er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of
05716 the forest_. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his
05717 newspaper. How's that for high?
05718 
05719 Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.
05720 
05721 Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
05722 
05723 The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_. O boys! O boys!
05724 
05725 And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on
05726 the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.
05727 
05728 That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don't want to
05729 hear any more of the stuff.
05730 
05731 He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
05732 hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.
05733 
05734 High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.
05735 Rather upsets a man's day, a funeral does. He has influence they
05736 say. Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his
05737 greatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death
05738 written this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first
05739 himself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges
05740 Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on
05741 gale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.
05742 
05743 Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.
05744 
05745 What is it? Mr Bloom asked.
05746 
05747 A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered
05748 with pomp of tone. _Our lovely land_. SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
05749 
05750 
05751 Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.
05752 
05753 Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an
05754 accent on the whose.
05755 
05756 Dan Dawson's land Mr Dedalus said.
05757 
05758 Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.
05759 
05760 Ned Lambert nodded.
05761 
05762 But listen to this, he said.
05763 
05764 The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was
05765 pushed in.
05766 
05767 Excuse me, J. J. O'Molloy said, entering.
05768 
05769 Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.
05770 
05771 I beg yours, he said.
05772 
05773 Good day, Jack.
05774 
05775 Come in. Come in.
05776 
05777 Good day.
05778 
05779 How are you, Dedalus?
05780 
05781 Well. And yourself?
05782 
05783 J. J. O'Molloy shook his head.
05784 
05785 SAD
05786 
05787 
05788 Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.
05789 That hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What's
05790 in the wind, I wonder. Money worry.
05791 
05792 Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._
05793 
05794 You're looking extra.
05795 
05796 Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O'Molloy asked, looking towards the
05797 inner door.
05798 
05799 Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He's in
05800 his sanctum with Lenehan.
05801 
05802 J. J. O'Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
05803 pink pages of the file.
05804 
05805 Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of
05806 honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and T.
05807 Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleeve
05808 like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the
05809 Express_ with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began
05810 on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when
05811 they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the same
05812 breath. Wouldn't know which to believe. One story good till you hear
05813 the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows
05814 over. Hail fellow well met the next moment.
05815 
05816 Ah, listen to this for God' sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. _Or again if we
05817 but climb the serried mountain peaks..._
05818 
05819 Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated
05820 windbag!
05821 
05822 Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our
05823 souls, as it were..._
05824 
05825 Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he
05826 taking anything for it?
05827 
05828 As 'twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland's portfolio,
05829 unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize
05830 regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and
05831 luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent
05832 translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._
05833 
05834 HIS NATIVE DORIC
05835 
05836 
05837 The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.
05838 
05839 That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of
05840 the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._
05841 
05842 O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and
05843 onions! That'll do, Ned. Life is too short.
05844 
05845 He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
05846 moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.
05847 
05848 Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An
05849 instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's
05850 unshaven blackspectacled face.
05851 
05852 Doughy Daw! he cried.
05853 
05854 WHAT WETHERUP SAID
05855 
05856 
05857 All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
05858 cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? Why they call
05859 him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that
05860 chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely.
05861 Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Get
05862 a grip of them by the stomach.
05863 
05864 The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested
05865 by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared
05866 about them and the harsh voice asked:
05867 
05868 What is it?
05869 
05870 And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said
05871 grandly.
05872 
05873 Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.
05874 
05875 Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink
05876 after that.
05877 
05878 Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.
05879 
05880 Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.
05881 
05882 Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor's blue eyes roved
05883 towards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile.
05884 
05885 Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.
05886 
05887 MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
05888 
05889 
05890 North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We
05891 won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
05892 
05893 Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
05894 his toecaps.
05895 
05896 In Ohio! the editor shouted.
05897 
05898 So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.
05899 
05900 Passing out he whispered to J. J. O'Molloy:
05901 
05902 Incipient jigs. Sad case.
05903 
05904 Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.
05905 My Ohio!
05906 
05907 A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.
05908 
05909 O, HARP EOLIAN!
05910 
05911 
05912 He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
05913 off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant
05914 unwashed teeth.
05915 
05916 Bingbang, bangbang.
05917 
05918 Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.
05919 
05920 Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.
05921 
05922 He went in.
05923 
05924 What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming
05925 to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.
05926 
05927 That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.
05928 Hello, Jack. That's all right.
05929 
05930 Good day, Myles, J. J. O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
05931 limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?
05932 
05933 The telephone whirred inside.
05934 
05935 Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes.
05936 
05937 SPOT THE WINNER
05938 
05939 
05940 Lenehan came out of the inner office with SPORT'S tissues.
05941 
05942 Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.
05943 Madden up.
05944 
05945 He tossed the tissues on to the table.
05946 
05947 Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
05948 flung open.
05949 
05950 Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.
05951 
05952 Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
05953 by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
05954 steps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
05955 blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.
05956 
05957 It wasn't me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.
05958 
05959 Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There's a hurricane
05960 blowing.
05961 
05962 Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
05963 stooped twice.
05964 
05965 Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat
05966 Farrell shoved me, sir.
05967 
05968 He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.
05969 
05970 Him, sir.
05971 
05972 Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.
05973 
05974 He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.
05975 
05976 J. J. O'Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
05977 
05978 Continued on page six, column four.
05979 
05980 Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.
05981 Is the boss...? Yes, _Telegraph_... To where? Aha! Which auction rooms
05982  Aha! I see... Right. I'll catch him.
05983 
05984 A COLLISION ENSUES
05985 
05986 
05987 The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped
05988 against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.
05989 
05990 Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and
05991 making a grimace.
05992 
05993 My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I'm in a
05994 hurry.
05995 
05996 Knee, Lenehan said.
05997 
05998 He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
05999 
06000 The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.
06001 
06002 Sorry, Mr Bloom said.
06003 
06004 He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O'Molloy slapped
06005 the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan,
06006 echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:
06007 
06008      _--We are the boys of Wexford
06009      Who fought with heart and hand._
06010 
06011 EXIT BLOOM
06012 
06013 
06014 I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this
06015 ad of Keyes's. Want to fix it up. They tell me he's round there in
06016 Dillon's.
06017 
06018 He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,
06019 leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
06020 suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.
06021 
06022 Begone! he said. The world is before you.
06023 
06024 Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.
06025 
06026 J. J. O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them,
06027 blowing them apart gently, without comment.
06028 
06029 He'll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
06030 blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps
06031 after him.
06032 
06033 Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.
06034 
06035 A STREET CORTEGE
06036 
06037 
06038 Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
06039 Bloom's wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
06040 tail of white bowknots.
06041 
06042 Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
06043 and you'll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the
06044 walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.
06045 
06046 He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
06047 feet past the fireplace to J. J. O'Molloy who placed the tissues in his
06048 receiving hands.
06049 
06050 What's that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two
06051 gone?
06052 
06053 Who? the professor said, turning. They're gone round to the Oval for a
06054 drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.
06055 
06056 Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where's my hat?
06057 
06058 He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
06059 jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the
06060 air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.
06061 
06062 He's pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.
06063 
06064 Seems to be, J. J. O'Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
06065 murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most
06066 matches?
06067 
06068 THE CALUMET OF PEACE
06069 
06070 
06071 He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan
06072 promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J.
06073 O'Molloy opened his case again and offered it.
06074 
06075 Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.
06076 
06077 The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He
06078 declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
06079 
06080 'Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, 'Twas empire charmed thy
06081 heart._
06082 
06083 The professor grinned, locking his long lips.
06084 
06085 Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.
06086 
06087 He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him
06088 with quick grace, said:
06089 
06090 Silence for my brandnew riddle!
06091 
06092 Imperium romanum_, J. J. O'Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than
06093 British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.
06094 
06095 Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.
06096 
06097 That's it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.
06098 We haven't got the chance of a snowball in hell.
06099 
06100 THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
06101 
06102 
06103 Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We
06104 mustn't be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,
06105 imperial, imperious, imperative.
06106 
06107 He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
06108 
06109 What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.
06110 The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet
06111 to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah_. The Roman, like the
06112 Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on
06113 which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal
06114 obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be
06115 here. Let us construct a watercloset._
06116 
06117 Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient
06118 ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial
06119 to the running stream.
06120 
06121 They were nature's gentlemen, J. J. O'Molloy murmured. But we have
06122 also Roman law.
06123 
06124 And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.
06125 
06126 Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O'Molloy asked.
06127 It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly
06128 
06129 
06130 First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?
06131 
06132 Mr O'Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from
06133 the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.
06134 
06135 Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.
06136 
06137 I escort a suppliant, Mr O'Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led by
06138 Experience visits Notoriety.
06139 
06140 How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your
06141 governor is just gone.???
06142 
06143 
06144 Lenehan said to all:
06145 
06146 Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,
06147 excogitate, reply.
06148 
06149 Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and
06150 signature.
06151 
06152 Who? the editor asked.
06153 
06154 Bit torn off.
06155 
06156 Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.
06157 
06158 That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?
06159 
06160      _On swift sail flaming
06161      From storm and south
06162      He comes, pale vampire,
06163      Mouth to my mouth._
06164 
06165 Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
06166 shoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?
06167 
06168 Bullockbefriending bard.
06169 
06170 SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
06171 
06172 
06173 Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr
06174 Garrett Deasy asked me to...
06175 
06176 O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The
06177 bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth
06178 disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter's
06179 face in the Star and Garter. Oho!
06180 
06181 A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of
06182 Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. O'Rourke, prince of Breffni.
06183 
06184 Is he a widower? Stephen asked.
06185 
06186 Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
06187 typescript. Emperor's horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on
06188 the ramparts of Vienna. Don't you forget! Maximilian Karl O'Donnell,
06189 graf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king
06190 an Austrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild
06191 geese. O yes, every time. Don't you forget that!
06192 
06193 The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O'Molloy said quietly,
06194 turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.
06195 
06196 Professor MacHugh turned on him.
06197 
06198 And if not? he said.
06199 
06200 I'll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one
06201 day... LOST CAUSES
06202 
06203 NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
06204 
06205 
06206 We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for
06207 us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never
06208 loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin
06209 language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is
06210 the maxim: time is money. Material domination. _Dominus!_ Lord! Where is
06211 the spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club.
06212 But the Greek!
06213 
06214 KYRIE ELEISON!
06215 
06216 
06217 A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long
06218 lips.
06219 
06220 The Greek! he said again. _Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the
06221 Semite and the Saxon know not. _Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.
06222 I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. _Kyrie eleison!_ The
06223 closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We
06224 are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at
06225 Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that
06226 went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went
06227 under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the
06228 fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.
06229 
06230 He strode away from them towards the window.
06231 
06232 They went forth to battle, Mr O'Madden Burke said greyly, but they
06233 always fell.
06234 
06235 Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in
06236 the latter half of the _matinie_. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!
06237 
06238 He whispered then near Stephen's ear:
06239 
06240 LENEHAN'S LIMERICK
06241 
06242 
06243      _There's a ponderous pundit MacHugh
06244      Who wears goggles of ebony hue.
06245      As he mostly sees double
06246      To wear them why trouble?
06247      I can't see the Joe Miller. Can you?_
06248 
06249 In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.
06250 
06251 Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.
06252 
06253 That'll be all right, he said. I'll read the rest after. That'll be
06254 all right.
06255 
06256 Lenehan extended his hands in protest.
06257 
06258 But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?
06259 
06260 Opera? Mr O'Madden Burke's sphinx face reriddled.
06261 
06262 Lenehan announced gladly:
06263 
06264 The Rose of Castile_. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!
06265 
06266 He poked Mr O'Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O'Madden Burke fell
06267 back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.
06268 
06269 Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.
06270 
06271 Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
06272 tissues.
06273 
06274 The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
06275 Stephen's and Mr O'Madden Burke's loose ties.
06276 
06277 Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.
06278 
06279 Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O'Molloy said in
06280 quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between
06281 you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.
06282 
06283 OMNIUM GATHERUM
06284 
06285 
06286 We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.
06287 
06288 All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...
06289 
06290 The turf, Lenehan put in.
06291 
06292 Literature, the press.
06293 
06294 If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of
06295 advertisement.
06296 
06297 And Madam Bloom, Mr O'Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin's
06298 prime favourite.
06299 
06300 Lenehan gave a loud cough.
06301 
06302 Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a
06303 cold in the park. The gate was open.
06304 
06305 YOU CAN DO IT!
06306 
06307 
06308 The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen's shoulder.
06309 
06310 I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite
06311 in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. _In the lexicon of youth_
06312 
06313 
06314 See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.
06315 
06316 Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great
06317 nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the
06318 public! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn
06319 its soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy.
06320 
06321 We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
06322 
06323 Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.
06324 
06325 He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O'Molloy said.
06326 
06327 THE GREAT GALLAHER
06328 
06329 
06330 You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in
06331 emphasis. Wait a minute. We'll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher
06332 used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the
06333 Clarence. Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You
06334 know how he made his mark? I'll tell you. That was the smartest piece of
06335 journalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of
06336 the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I
06337 suppose. I'll show you.
06338 
06339 He pushed past them to the files.
06340 
06341 Look at here, he said turning. The _New York World_ cabled for a
06342 special. Remember that time?
06343 
06344 Professor MacHugh nodded.
06345 
06346 New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw
06347 hat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and
06348 the rest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?
06349 
06350 Skin-the-Goat, Mr O'Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that
06351 cabman's shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.
06352 You know Holohan?
06353 
06354 Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.
06355 
06356 And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for
06357 the corporation. A night watchman.
06358 
06359 Stephen turned in surprise.
06360 
06361 Gumley? he said. You don't say so? A friend of my father's, is it?
06362 
06363 Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind
06364 the stones, see they don't run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius
06365 Gallaher do? I'll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away.
06366 Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?
06367 
06368 He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.
06369 
06370 Take page four, advertisement for Bransome's coffee, let us say. Have
06371 you got that? Right.
06372 
06373 The telephone whirred.
06374 
06375 A DISTANT VOICE
06376 
06377 
06378 I'll answer it, the professor said, going.
06379 
06380 B is parkgate. Good.
06381 
06382 His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.
06383 
06384 T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon
06385 gate.
06386 
06387 The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock's wattles. An illstarched
06388 dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
06389 waistcoat.
06390 
06391 Hello? _Evening Telegraph_ here... Hello?... Who's there?... Yes...
06392 Yes... Yes.
06393 
06394 F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,
06395 Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P.
06396 Got that? X is Davy's publichouse in upper Leeson street.
06397 
06398 The professor came to the inner door.
06399 
06400 Bloom is at the telephone, he said.
06401 
06402 Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy's
06403 publichouse, see? CLEVER, VERY
06404 
06405 
06406 Clever, Lenehan said. Very.
06407 
06408 Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody
06409 history.
06410 
06411 Nightmare from which you will never awake.
06412 
06413 I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the
06414 besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
06415 myself.
06416 
06417 Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
06418 
06419 Madam, I'm Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.
06420 
06421 History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince's street was
06422 there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of
06423 an advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the
06424 leg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._
06425 Now he's got in with Blumenfeld. That's press. That's talent. Pyatt! He
06426 was all their daddies!
06427 
06428 The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
06429 brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.
06430 
06431 Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he's here still. Come across
06432 yourself.
06433 
06434 Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried. He
06435 flung the pages down.
06436 
06437 Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O'Madden Burke.
06438 
06439 Very smart, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
06440 
06441 Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.
06442 
06443 Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers
06444 were up before the recorder?
06445 
06446 O yes, J. J. O'Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home
06447 through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that
06448 cyclone last year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin. And it
06449 turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or
06450 Skin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!
06451 
06452 They're only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.
06453 Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those
06454 fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O'Hagan.
06455 Eh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.
06456 
06457 His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.
06458 
06459 Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you
06460 write it then?
06461 
06462 RHYMES AND REASONS
06463 
06464 
06465 Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be
06466 some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the same,
06467 looking the same, two by two.
06468 
06469      _........................ la tua pace
06470     .................. che parlar ti piace
06471     .... mentrechi il vento, come fa, si tace._
06472 
06473 He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in
06474 russet, entwining, _per l'aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella
06475 pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fe piu ardenti._
06476 But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth
06477 south: tomb womb.
06478 
06479 Speak up for yourself, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
06480 
06481 SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...
06482 
06483 
06484 J. J. O'Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.
06485 
06486 My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false
06487 construction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for
06488 the third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away
06489 with you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and
06490 Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss,
06491 Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery
06492 guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly's Budget, Pue's Occurrences_
06493 and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_. Why bring in a master
06494 of forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the
06495 newspaper thereof. LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE
06496 
06497 
06498 Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his
06499 face. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.
06500 Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!
06501 
06502 Well, J. J. O'Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.
06503 
06504 Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it
06505 in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.
06506 
06507 He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for
06508  But no matter.
06509 
06510 J. J. O'Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:
06511 
06512 One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life
06513 fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,
06514 the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him. _And in the porches of mine
06515 ear did pour._
06516 
06517 
06518 By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other
06519 story, beast with two backs?
06520 
06521 What was that? the professor asked.
06522 
06523 ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
06524 
06525 
06526 He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O'Molloy said, of Roman justice
06527 as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_. And he
06528 cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.
06529 
06530 Ha.
06531 
06532 A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!
06533 
06534 Pause. J. J. O'Molloy took out his cigarettecase.
06535 
06536 False lull. Something quite ordinary.
06537 
06538 Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.
06539 
06540 I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that
06541 it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,
06542 that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. A POLISHED
06543 PERIOD
06544 
06545 
06546 J. J. O'Molloy resumed, moulding his words:
06547 
06548 He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and
06549 terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and
06550 of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor
06551 has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring
06552 deserves to live, deserves to live._
06553 
06554 His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.
06555 
06556 Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.
06557 
06558 The divine afflatus, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
06559 
06560 You like it? J. J. O'Molloy asked Stephen.
06561 
06562 Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He
06563 took a cigarette from the case. J. J. O'Molloy offered his case to Myles
06564 Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy,
06565 saying:
06566 
06567 Muchibus thankibus.
06568 
06569 A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
06570 
06571 
06572 Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O'Molloy said
06573 to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal
06574 hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it.
06575 She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee
06576 interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to
06577 ask him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have
06578 been pulling A. E.'s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale,
06579 Magennis.
06580 
06581 Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say
06582 about me? Don't ask.
06583 
06584 No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.
06585 Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I
06586 ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
06587 society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
06588 spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
06589 advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.
06590 
06591 He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
06592 
06593 You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his
06594 discourse.
06595 
06596 He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O'Molloy said, rumour has it, on
06597 the Trinity college estates commission.
06598 
06599 He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child's
06600 frock. Go on. Well?
06601 
06602 It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
06603 full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will
06604 not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man's contumely
06605 upon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak,
06606 therefore worthless.
06607 
06608 He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised
06609 an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
06610 ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new
06611 focus.
06612 
06613 IMPROMPTU
06614 
06615 
06616 In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O'Molloy:
06617 
06618 Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he
06619 had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
06620 shorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
06621 beard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
06622 looked (though he was not) a dying man.
06623 
06624 His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O'Molloy's towards
06625 Stephen's face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His
06626 unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
06627 withering hair. Still seeking, he said:
06628 
06629 When Fitzgibbon's speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.
06630 Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.
06631 
06632 He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.
06633 Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.
06634 
06635 He began:
06636 
06637 Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in
06638 listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment
06639 since by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported
06640 into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from
06641 this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the
06642 speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses._
06643 
06644 His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
06645 ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. _And let our
06646 crooked smokes._ Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand
06647 at it yourself?
06648 
06649 And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian
06650 highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard
06651 his words and their meaning was revealed to me._
06652 
06653 FROM THE FATHERS
06654 
06655 
06656 It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted
06657 which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good
06658 could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That's saint Augustine.
06659 
06660 Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
06661 language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You
06662 have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and
06663 our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise
06664 furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from
06665 primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong
06666 history and a polity._
06667 
06668 Nile.
06669 
06670 Child, man, effigy.
06671 
06672 By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple
06673 in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.
06674 
06675 You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and
06676 mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.
06677 Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel
06678 is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her
06679 arms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
06680 our name._
06681 
06682 A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it
06683 boldly:
06684 
06685 But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and
06686 accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
06687 and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have
06688 brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed
06689 the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the
06690 Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down
06691 with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in
06692 his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw._
06693 
06694 He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.
06695 
06696 OMINOUS--FOR HIM!
06697 
06698 J. J. O'Molloy said not without regret:
06699 
06700 And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.
06701 
06702 A sudden--at--the--moment--though--from--lingering--illness--often--
06703 previously--expectorated--demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future
06704 behind him.
06705 
06706 The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering
06707 up the staircase.
06708 
06709 That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. Gone with the
06710 wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of ears of
06711 porches. The tribune's words, howled and scattered to the four winds.
06712 A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records of all
06713 that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.
06714 
06715 I have money.
06716 
06717 Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I
06718 suggest that the house do now adjourn?
06719 
06720 You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment?
06721 Mr O'Madden Burke asked. 'Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,
06722 metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.
06723 
06724 That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour
06725 say ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To
06726 which particular boosing shed?... My casting vote is: Mooney's!
06727 
06728 He led the way, admonishing:
06729 
06730 We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,
06731 we will not. By no manner of means.
06732 
06733 Mr O'Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally's lunge of his
06734 umbrella:
06735 
06736 Lay on, Macduff!
06737 
06738 Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the
06739 shoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?
06740 
06741 He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.
06742 
06743 Foot and mouth. I know. That'll be all right. That'll go in. Where are
06744 they? That's all right.
06745 
06746 He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office. LET US HOPE
06747 
06748 
06749 J. J. O'Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:
06750 
06751 I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.
06752 
06753 He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.
06754 
06755 Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn't it? It
06756 has the prophetic vision. _Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms
06757 of this world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.
06758 
06759 The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
06760 rushed out into the street, yelling:
06761 
06762 Racing special!
06763 
06764 Dublin. I have much, much to learn.
06765 
06766 They turned to the left along Abbey street.
06767 
06768 I have a vision too, Stephen said.
06769 
06770 Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will
06771 follow.
06772 
06773 Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:
06774 
06775 Racing special!
06776 
06777 DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN
06778 
06779 
06780 Dubliners.
06781 
06782 Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty
06783 and fiftythree years in Fumbally's lane.
06784 
06785 Where is that? the professor asked.
06786 
06787 Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.
06788 
06789 Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering
06790 tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker,
06791 darlint!
06792 
06793 On now. Dare it. Let there be life.
06794 
06795 They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar.
06796 They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They
06797 shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies
06798 with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven
06799 in coppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
06800 umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.
06801 
06802 Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.
06803 
06804 LIFE ON THE RAW
06805 
06806 
06807 They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
06808 the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,
06809 proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl
06810 at the foot of Nelson's pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They
06811 give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin
06812 to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each
06813 other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the
06814 brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down,
06815 peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that
06816 high.
06817 
06818 Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the
06819 lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got
06820 a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen
06821 and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.
06822 
06823 Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can
06824 see them. What's keeping our friend?
06825 
06826 He turned.
06827 
06828 A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all
06829 directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them
06830 Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet
06831 face, talking with J. J. O'Molloy.
06832 
06833 Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.
06834 
06835 He set off again to walk by Stephen's side. RETURN OF BLOOM
06836 
06837 
06838 Yes, he said. I see them.
06839 
06840 Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
06841 offices of the _Irish Catholic and Dublin Penny Journal_, called:
06842 
06843 Mr Crawford! A moment!
06844 
06845 Telegraph_! Racing special!
06846 
06847 What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.
06848 
06849 A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom's face:
06850 
06851 Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!
06852 
06853 INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR
06854 
06855 
06856 Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
06857 puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes
06858 just now. He'll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he'll
06859 see. But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too,
06860 the Saturday pink. And he wants it copied if it's not too late I told
06861 councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_. I can have access to
06862 it in the national library. House of keys, don't you see? His name is
06863 Keyes. It's a play on the name. But he practically promised he'd give
06864 the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr
06865 Crawford? K.M.A.
06866 
06867 
06868 Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing
06869 out his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.
06870 
06871 A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.
06872 Lenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is
06873 that young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him
06874 today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in
06875 muck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?
06876 
06877 Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I
06878 suppose it's worth a short par. He'd give the ad, I think. I'll tell him
06879  K.M.R.I.A.
06880 
06881 
06882 He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his
06883 shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.
06884 
06885 While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on
06886 jerkily.
06887 
06888 RAISING THE WIND
06889 
06890 
06891 Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I'm up to
06892 here. I've been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to
06893 back a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take
06894 the will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind
06895 anyhow.
06896 
06897 J. J. O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught up
06898 on the others and walked abreast.
06899 
06900 When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty
06901 fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the
06902 railings.
06903 
06904 Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old
06905 Dublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar.
06906 
06907 SOME COLUMN!--THAT'S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID
06908 
06909 
06910 That's new, Myles Crawford said. That's copy. Out for the waxies
06911 Dargle. Two old trickies, what?
06912 
06913 But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see
06914 the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines'
06915 blue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's. But it makes them
06916 giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...
06917 
06918 THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES
06919 
06920 
06921 Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We're in the
06922 archdiocese here.
06923 
06924 And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue
06925 of the onehandled adulterer.
06926 
06927 Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the
06928 idea. I see what you mean.
06929 
06930 DAMES DONATE DUBLIN'S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF
06931 
06932 
06933 It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too
06934 tired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between
06935 them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with
06936 their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and
06937 spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.
06938 
06939 He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O'Madden
06940 Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney's.
06941 
06942 Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.
06943 
06944 SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH
06945 MOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.
06946 
06947 
06948 You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of
06949 Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were
06950 bitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble
06951 and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of
06952 beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.
06953 
06954 Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.
06955 
06956 They made ready to cross O'Connell street.
06957 
06958 HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!
06959 
06960 
06961 At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless
06962 trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,
06963 Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend
06964 and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines,
06965 all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs, delivery
06966 waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with
06967 rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.
06968 
06969 WHAT?--AND LIKEWISE--WHERE?
06970 
06971 
06972 But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the
06973 plums?
06974 
06975 VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.
06976 
06977 
06978 Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to
06979 reflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: _deus nobis haec otia fecit._
06980 
06981 No, Stephen said. I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or the
06982 Parable of The Plums._
06983 
06984 I see, the professor said.
06985 
06986 He laughed richly.
06987 
06988 I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land.
06989 We gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O'Molloy.
06990 
06991 HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY
06992 
06993 
06994 J. J. O'Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held
06995 his peace.
06996 
06997 I see, the professor said.
06998 
06999 He halted on sir John Gray's pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson
07000 through the meshes of his wry smile.
07001 
07002 DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE WIMBLES,
07003 FLO WANGLES--YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?
07004 
07005 
07006 Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must
07007 say.
07008 
07009 Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty's
07010 truth was known.
07011 
07012 
07013 Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugarsticky girl
07014 shovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school
07015 treat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His
07016 Majesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne sucking red
07017 jujubes white.
07018 
07019 
07020 A sombre Y.M.C.A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of
07021 Graham Lemon's, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.
07022 
07023 Heart to heart talks.
07024 
07025 Bloo... Me? No.
07026 
07027 Blood of the Lamb.
07028 
07029 His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are
07030 washed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen,
07031 martyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering,
07032 druids' altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of
07033 the church in Zion is coming.
07034 
07035 Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!! All heartily welcome._ Paying game.
07036 Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put the stopper
07037 on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the luminous crucifix.
07038 Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see him on the wall,
07039 hanging. Pepper's ghost idea. Iron nails ran in.
07040 
07041 
07042 Phosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for
07043 instance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to the
07044 pantry in the kitchen. Don't like all the smells in it waiting to rush
07045 out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of Spain.
07046 Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good
07047 for the brain.
07048 
07049 From Butler's monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor's walk.
07050 Dedalus' daughter there still outside Dillon's auctionrooms. Must be
07051 selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father.
07052 Lobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother
07053 goes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That's in their
07054 theology or the priest won't give the poor woman the confession, the
07055 absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat
07056 you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the
07057 fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I'd like to see them do
07058 the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear
07059 he'd collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows if you
07060 could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting l.s.d.
07061 out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one. Watching
07062 his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence: mum's the
07063 word.
07064 
07065 Good Lord, that poor child's dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks
07066 too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It's after they feel it.
07067 Proof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.
07068 
07069 As he set foot on O'Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from
07070 the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it,
07071 I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the
07072 brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats get in
07073 too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on
07074 the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking
07075 that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the things.
07076 
07077 Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt
07078 quaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben
07079 J's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and
07080 eightpence too much. Hhhhm. It's the droll way he comes out with the
07081 things. Knows how to tell a story too.
07082 
07083 They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.
07084 
07085 He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet
07086 per sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of
07087 swells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the
07088 day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin's King picked it up in the
07089 wake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.
07090 
07091      _The hungry famished gull
07092      Flaps o'er the waters dull._
07093 
07094 That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has
07095 no rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts.
07096 Solemn.
07097 
07098 
07099      _Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit
07100      Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth._
07101      --Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!
07102 
07103 
07104 His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians
07105 they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag
07106 or a handkerchief.
07107 
07108 Wait. Those poor birds.
07109 
07110 He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for
07111 a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into
07112 the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from
07113 their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.
07114 
07115 Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his
07116 hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they
07117 have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down
07118 here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder
07119 what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.
07120 
07121 They wheeled flapping weakly. I'm not going to throw any more. Penny
07122 quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and
07123 mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes
07124 like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are
07125 not salty? How is that?
07126 
07127 His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor
07128 on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.
07129 
07130 Kino's_ 11/- _Trousers_
07131 
07132 Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you
07133 own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same, which
07134 in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of
07135 places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck
07136 up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr
07137 Hy Franks. Didn't cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self
07138 advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or stick them up himself for
07139 that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen a button. Flybynight.
07140 Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose
07141 burning him.
07142 
07143 If he...?
07144 
07145 O!
07146 
07147 Eh?
07148 
07149 No... No.
07150 
07151 No, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely?
07152 
07153 No, no.
07154 
07155 Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about
07156 that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time.
07157 Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never
07158 exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par it's Greek:
07159 parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her
07160 about the transmigration. O rocks!
07161 
07162 Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She's right
07163 after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.
07164 She's not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking.
07165 Still, I don't know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone
07166 voice. He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was singing into a
07167 barrel. Now, isn't that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as
07168 witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get
07169 outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away number
07170 one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.
07171 
07172 A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him
07173 along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like
07174 that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He
07175 read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S.
07176 Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his
07177 foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our
07178 staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after
07179 street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are
07180 not Boyl: no, M Glade's men. Doesn't bring in any business either.
07181 I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls
07182 sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I
07183 bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the
07184 eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's writing. Get twenty of
07185 them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women
07186 too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he
07187 didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a
07188 false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted
07189 under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em. What?
07190 Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can't stop, Robinson,
07191 I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser _Kansell,_ sold
07192 by Hely's Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a
07193 job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent.
07194 That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small
07195 head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.
07196 Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her
07197 devotions that morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world.
07198 Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name
07199 too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had
07200 married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of
07201 money. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for
07202 them. My heart's broke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves
07203 in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the
07204 pawnbroker's daughter. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.
07205 
07206 He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover
07207 cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil
07208 Gilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom's.
07209 Got the job in Wisdom Hely's year we married. Six years. Ten years ago:
07210 ninetyfour he died yes that's right the big fire at Arnott's. Val Dillon
07211 was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O'Reilly emptying
07212 the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the
07213 inner alderman. Couldn't hear what the band played. For what we have
07214 already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly
07215 had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored with
07216 selfcovered buttons. She didn't like it because I sprained my ankle
07217 first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old
07218 Goodwin's tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies' picnic
07219 too. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove,
07220 shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we
07221 had that day. People looking after her.
07222 
07223 Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.
07224 Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night. American
07225 soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she
07226 looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's
07227 daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.
07228 
07229 He walked along the curbstone.
07230 
07231 Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always
07232 squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron's saint
07233 Kevin's parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen
07234  Of course it's years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he
07235 couldn't remember the dayfather's name that he sees every day.
07236 
07237 Bartell d'Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home
07238 after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her
07239 that song _Winds that blow from the south_.
07240 
07241 Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on
07242 about those lottery tickets after Goodwin's concert in the supperroom or
07243 oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew
07244 out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didn't.
07245 Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin
07246 linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell
07247 concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and
07248 may be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar
07249 up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her
07250 skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed
07251 in the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up
07252 those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she
07253 liked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth
07254 unclamping the busk of her stays: white.
07255 
07256 Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her.
07257 Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two
07258 taking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.
07259 That was the night...
07260 
07261 O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?
07262 
07263 O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?
07264 
07265 No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven't seen her for
07266 ages.
07267 
07268 In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in
07269 Mullingar, you know.
07270 
07271 Go away! Isn't that grand for her?
07272 
07273 Yes. In a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire. How
07274 are all your charges?
07275 
07276 All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said.
07277 
07278 How many has she? No other in sight.
07279 
07280 You're in black, I see. You have no...
07281 
07282 No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.
07283 
07284 Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he
07285 die of? Turn up like a bad penny.
07286 
07287 O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn't any near relation.
07288 
07289 May as well get her sympathy.
07290 
07291 Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,
07292 poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.
07293 
07294 Your funeral's tomorrow While you're coming through the rye.
07295 Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle..._
07296 
07297 Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen's womaneyes said melancholily.
07298 
07299 Now that's quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.
07300 
07301 And your lord and master?
07302 
07303 Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn't lost them anyhow.
07304 
07305 O, don't be talking! she said. He's a caution to rattlesnakes. He's
07306 in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me
07307 heartscalded. Wait till I show you.
07308 
07309 Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured
07310 out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's
07311 gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,
07312 or they'd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot
07313 arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of
07314 hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork
07315 chained to the table.
07316 
07317 Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on
07318 those things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.
07319 Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain.
07320 Husband barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are
07321 you feeding your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief:
07322 medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...
07323 
07324 There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do you
07325 know what he did last night?
07326 
07327 Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in
07328 alarm, yet smiling.
07329 
07330 What? Mr Bloom asked.
07331 
07332 Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.
07333 
07334 Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.
07335 
07336 Indiges.
07337 
07338 Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.
07339 
07340 The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.
07341 
07342 She took a folded postcard from her handbag.
07343 
07344 Read that, she said. He got it this morning.
07345 
07346 What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?
07347 
07348 U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great
07349 shame for them whoever he is.
07350 
07351 Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.
07352 
07353 She took back the card, sighing.
07354 
07355 And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. He's going to take an
07356 action for ten thousand pounds, he says.
07357 
07358 She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.
07359 
07360 Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its
07361 best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old
07362 grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a
07363 tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than
07364 Molly.
07365 
07366 See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.
07367 
07368 He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.
07369 Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of pastry
07370 on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.
07371 Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell
07372 that was. In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the charades. U.P.:
07373 up.
07374 
07375 Change the subject.
07376 
07377 Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.
07378 
07379 Mina Purefoy? she said.
07380 
07381 Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' Club. Matcham often thinks of
07382 the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.
07383 
07384 Yes.
07385 
07386 I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She's in the
07387 lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She's three
07388 days bad now.
07389 
07390 O, Mr Bloom said. I'm sorry to hear that.
07391 
07392 Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It's a very stiff
07393 birth, the nurse told me.
07394 
07395 O, Mr Bloom said.
07396 
07397 His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in
07398 compassion. Dth! Dth!
07399 
07400 I'm sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That's
07401 terrible for her.
07402 
07403 Mrs Breen nodded.
07404 
07405 She was taken bad on the Tuesday...
07406 
07407 Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
07408 
07409 Mind! Let this man pass.
07410 
07411 A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a
07412 rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a
07413 skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,
07414 a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.
07415 
07416 Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts.
07417 Watch!
07418 
07419 Who is he if it's a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?
07420 
07421 His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr
07422 Bloom said smiling. Watch!
07423 
07424 He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these
07425 days.
07426 
07427 She broke off suddenly.
07428 
07429 There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to
07430 Molly, won't you?
07431 
07432 I will, Mr Bloom said.
07433 
07434 He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen
07435 in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison's
07436 hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old
07437 times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust
07438 his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke
07439 earnestly.
07440 
07441 Meshuggah. Off his chump.
07442 
07443 Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the
07444 tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two
07445 days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world.
07446 And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have
07447 with him.
07448 
07449 U.P.: up. I'll take my oath that's Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote
07450 it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton's
07451 office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the
07452 gods.
07453 
07454 He passed the _Irish Times_. There might be other answers Iying there.
07455 Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch
07456 now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn't know me. O, leave them there
07457 to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart
07458 lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty
07459 darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is
07460 the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife. Tell me who
07461 made the world. The way they spring those questions on you. And the
07462 other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to
07463 meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo. Russell). No
07464 time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.
07465 
07466 Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook
07467 and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit
07468 counter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop.
07469 James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made a big
07470 deal on Coates's shares. Ca' canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the
07471 toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the _Irish Field_
07472 now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and
07473 rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement yesterday
07474 at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects juices make
07475 it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse like a man.
07476 Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe.
07477 First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of
07478 those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass
07479 of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this
07480 morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate
07481 put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who
07482 is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old
07483 wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish
07484 American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was
07485 her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park
07486 ranger got me in with Whelan of the _Express._ Scavenging what the
07487 quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was
07488 custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to
07489 be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.
07490 
07491 Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun
07492 and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating
07493 with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his
07494 muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore's
07495 cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy
07496 annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers
07497 marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a
07498 marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast
07499 year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t's are. Dog in
07500 the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.
07501 
07502 He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at
07503 Rowe's? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in
07504 the Burton. Better. On my way.
07505 
07506 He walked on past Bolton's Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot
07507 to tap Tom Kernan.
07508 
07509 Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a
07510 vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew!
07511 Dreadful simply! Child's head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her
07512 trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me
07513 that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent
07514 something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea:
07515 queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old
07516 woman that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was
07517 consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the
07518 what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to
07519 feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing
07520 quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at
07521 compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings
07522 and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage
07523 people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years
07524 want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.
07525 
07526 Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for
07527 nothing.
07528 
07529 Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs
07530 Moisel. Mothers' meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then
07531 returns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes. Weight
07532 off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies,
07533 she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that's
07534 nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall's son. His first bow to
07535 the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking
07536 them up at all hours. For God' sake, doctor. Wife in her throes. Then
07537 keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on your wife. No
07538 gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.
07539 
07540 Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of
07541 pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I
07542 pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here's good luck. Must be thrilling
07543 from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near
07544 Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.
07545 
07546 A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian
07547 file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their
07548 truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their
07549 belts. Policeman's lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and
07550 scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment
07551 to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others,
07552 marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station.
07553 Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive
07554 soup.
07555 
07556 He crossed under Tommy Moore's roguish finger. They did right to put him
07557 up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women.
07558 Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. _There is not in this
07559 wide world a vallee_. Great song of Julia Morkan's. Kept her voice up to
07560 the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe's, wasn't she?
07561 
07562 He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack
07563 Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble
07564 being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell.
07565 Can't blame them after all with the job they have especially the young
07566 hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his
07567 degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His
07568 horse's hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had the
07569 presence of mind to dive into Manning's or I was souped. He did come a
07570 wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I
07571 oughtn't to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the
07572 Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to
07573 know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now
07574 he's in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police
07575 whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in
07576 charge. Right here it began.
07577 
07578 Up the Boers!
07579 
07580 Three cheers for De Wet!
07581 
07582 We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.
07583 
07584 Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill.
07585 The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and
07586 civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows
07587 used to. Whether on the scaffold high.
07588 
07589 Never know who you're talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in
07590 his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on
07591 the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to
07592 get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle.
07593 Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always
07594 courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up
07595 against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And
07596 who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying
07597 anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young
07598 student fooling round her fat arms ironing.
07599 
07600 Are those yours, Mary?
07601 
07602 I don't wear such things... Stop or I'll tell the missus on you. Out
07603 half the night.
07604 
07605 There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.
07606 
07607 Ah, gelong with your great times coming.
07608 
07609 Barmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.
07610 
07611 James Stephens' idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that
07612 a fellow couldn't round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out
07613 you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey's
07614 daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the
07615 Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.
07616 
07617 You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a
07618 squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about
07619 our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company's tearoom.
07620 Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government.
07621 That the language question should take precedence of the economic
07622 question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them
07623 up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here's a good lump of thyme
07624 seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease
07625 before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk with
07626 the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap pays
07627 best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show us
07628 over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule
07629 sun rising up in the northwest.
07630 
07631 His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly,
07632 shadowing Trinity's surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing,
07633 outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day:
07634 squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies
07635 mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a
07636 bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second
07637 somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes.
07638 Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born, washing the
07639 blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.
07640 
07641 Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other
07642 coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of
07643 pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that.
07644 Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets
07645 his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have
07646 all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age
07647 after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese
07648 wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling
07649 suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan's mushroom houses built of breeze. Shelter,
07650 for the night.
07651 
07652 No-one is anything.
07653 
07654 This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate
07655 this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.
07656 
07657 Provost's house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in
07658 there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn't live in it if they paid me. Hope
07659 they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.
07660 
07661 The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware
07662 opposite in Walter Sexton's window by which John Howard Parnell passed,
07663 unseeing.
07664 
07665 There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that's a
07666 coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don't
07667 meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a
07668 corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal's
07669 uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on
07670 his high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the
07671 woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a
07672 pain. Great man's brother: his brother's brother. He'd look nice on the
07673 city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess
07674 there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to
07675 pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That's the
07676 fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other sister
07677 Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright lik
07678 surgeon M'Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply
07679 for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The patriot's
07680 banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said when they
07681 put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and
07682 lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.
07683 
07684 Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which
07685 the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with
07686 a Scotch accent. The tentacles...
07687 
07688 They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle.
07689 Young woman.
07690 
07691 And there he is too. Now that's really a coincidence: second time.
07692 Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the
07693 eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A.
07694 E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund,
07695 Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world
07696 with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism.
07697 Holding forth. She's taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid
07698 gentleman in literary work.
07699 
07700 His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle,
07701 a listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only
07702 weggebobbles and fruit. Don't eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of
07703 that cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it's healthier.
07704 Windandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as
07705 a bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me
07706 nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating
07707 rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the
07708 tap all night.
07709 
07710 Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless.
07711 Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy,
07712 symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it was that
07713 kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.
07714 For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts
07715 you couldn't squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know what poetry
07716 is even. Must be in a certain mood.
07717 
07718      _The dreamy cloudy gull
07719      Waves o'er the waters dull._
07720 
07721 He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates
07722 and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old Harris's and
07723 have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow. Probably at his
07724 lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right. Goerz lenses six
07725 guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to
07726 capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost
07727 property office. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in
07728 trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about? Women too.
07729 Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer's
07730 daughter's ba and hand it to her at Limerick junction. Unclaimed money
07731 too. There's a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test
07732 those glasses by.
07733 
07734 
07735 His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can't see it. If you
07736 imagine it's there you can almost see it. Can't see it.
07737 
07738 He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right
07739 hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes:
07740 completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk.
07741 Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses.
07742 Interesting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we
07743 were in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific
07744 explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn
07745 some time.
07746 
07747 Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's
07748 the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there
07749 some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to
07750 professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to:
07751 man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman
07752 proud to be descended from some king's mistress. His foremother. Lay it
07753 on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt
07754 out what you know you're not to: what's parallax? Show this gentleman
07755 the door.
07756 
07757 Ah.
07758 
07759 His hand fell to his side again.
07760 
07761 Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,
07762 crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid:
07763 then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock,
07764 like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I
07765 believe there is.
07766 
07767 He went on by la maison Claire.
07768 
07769 Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there
07770 is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon.
07771 She was humming. The young May moon she's beaming, love. He other side
07772 of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm's la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch.
07773 Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.
07774 
07775 Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.
07776 
07777 Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.
07778 
07779 With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here
07780 middle of the day of Bob Doran's bottle shoulders. On his annual bend,
07781 M Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or _cherchez la
07782 femme_. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the
07783 rest of the year sober as a judge.
07784 
07785 Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him
07786 good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the
07787 Queen's. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon
07788 face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies,
07789 eh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking,
07790 laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat.
07791 Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white
07792 hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp
07793 that once did starve us all.
07794 
07795 I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She
07796 twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could
07797 never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time. Like holding
07798 water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then.
07799 Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?
07800 Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.
07801 
07802 Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,
07803 silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the
07804 baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope
07805 the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to
07806 the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of
07807 plumb.
07808 
07809 He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades
07810 of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a
07811 flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that
07812 here. _La causa h santa_! Tara tara. Great chorus that. Taree tara. Must
07813 be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.
07814 
07815 Pincushions. I'm a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all
07816 over the place. Needles in window curtains.
07817 
07818 He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today
07819 anyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps.
07820 Junejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn't
07821 like it. Women won't pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.
07822 
07823 Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk
07824 stockings.
07825 
07826 Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.
07827 
07828 High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and
07829 houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim.
07830 Wealth of the world.
07831 
07832 A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded.
07833 Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he
07834 mutely craved to adore.
07835 
07836 Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.
07837 
07838 He turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds.
07839 Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields,
07840 tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas,
07841 creaking beds.
07842 
07843 Jack, love!
07844 
07845 Darling!
07846 
07847 Kiss me, Reggy!
07848 
07849 My boy!
07850 
07851 Love!
07852 
07853 His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink
07854 gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See
07855 the animals feed.
07856 
07857 Men, men, men.
07858 
07859 Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables
07860 calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy
07861 food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced
07862 young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New
07863 set of microbes. A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked round
07864 him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his
07865 plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump
07866 chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten
07867 off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see
07868 us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don't! O! A bone!
07869 That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself
07870 at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something
07871 galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn't
07872 swallow it all however.
07873 
07874 Roast beef and cabbage.
07875 
07876 One stew.
07877 
07878 Smells of men. His gorge rose. Spaton sawdust, sweetish warmish
07879 cigarette smoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men's beery piss, the stale
07880 of ferment.
07881 
07882 Couldn't eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all
07883 before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing
07884 the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then
07885 on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it
07886 off the plate, man! Get out of this.
07887 
07888 He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of
07889 his nose.
07890 
07891 Two stouts here.
07892 
07893 One corned and cabbage.
07894 
07895 That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended
07896 on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his
07897 three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a
07898 silver knife in his mouth. That's witty, I think. Or no. Silver means
07899 born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.
07900 
07901 An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head
07902 bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well
07903 up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright,
07904 elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift
07905 across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him something
07906 with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un
07907 thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?
07908 
07909 Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:
07910 
07911 Not here. Don't see him.
07912 
07913 Out. I hate dirty eaters.
07914 
07915 He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne's. Stopgap.
07916 Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.
07917 
07918 Roast and mashed here.
07919 
07920 Pint of stout.
07921 
07922 Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.
07923 
07924 He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat
07925 or be eaten. Kill! Kill!
07926 
07927 Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down
07928 with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the
07929 street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every
07930 mother's son don't talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women
07931 and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From
07932 Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans' dwellings, north Dublin union,
07933 lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My
07934 plate's empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir
07935 Philip Crampton's fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief.
07936 Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O'Flynn would make
07937 hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number one. Children
07938 fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the
07939 Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate
07940 people all round you. City Arms hotel _table d'htte_ she called it.
07941 Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you're chewing. Then
07942 who'd wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids
07943 that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.
07944 
07945 After all there's a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from
07946 the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp
07947 of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw
07948 fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe
07949 to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering
07950 bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers' buckets wobbly lights. Give us that
07951 brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed
07952 sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling
07953 nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don't maul them pieces,
07954 young one.
07955 
07956 Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed.
07957 Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.
07958 
07959 Ah, I'm hungry.
07960 
07961 He entered Davy Byrne's. Moral pub. He doesn't chat. Stands a drink now
07962 and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.
07963 
07964 What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?
07965 
07966 Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.
07967 
07968 Hello, Flynn.
07969 
07970 How's things?
07971 
07972 Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me
07973 see.
07974 
07975 Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham
07976 and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home
07977 without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the
07978 obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's potted meat.
07979 Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like
07980 pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be
07981 tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. _There was
07982 a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the
07983 reverend Mr MacTrigger_. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what
07984 concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle
07985 find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what
07986 they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and
07987 war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and
07988 geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards
07989 full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.
07990 
07991 Have you a cheese sandwich?
07992 
07993 Yes, sir.
07994 
07995 Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of
07996 burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,
07997 Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served
07998 me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made
07999 food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.
08000 
08001 Wife well?
08002 
08003 Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?
08004 
08005 Yes, sir.
08006 
08007 Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.
08008 
08009 Doing any singing those times?
08010 
08011 Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.
08012 Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.
08013 Does no harm. Free ad.
08014 
08015 She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard
08016 perhaps.
08017 
08018 No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?
08019 
08020 The curate served.
08021 
08022 How much is that?
08023 
08024 Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.
08025 
08026 Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. _Mr MacTrigger_. Easier
08027 than the dreamy creamy stuff. _His five hundred wives. Had the time of
08028 their lives._
08029 
08030 Mustard, sir?
08031 
08032 Thank you.
08033 
08034 He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. _Their lives_. I have
08035 it. _It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.
08036 
08037 Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see. Part
08038 shares and part profits.
08039 
08040 Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket
08041 to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan
08042 mixed up in it?
08043 
08044 A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart. He
08045 raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock
08046 five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.
08047 
08048 His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,
08049 longingly.
08050 
08051 Wine.
08052 
08053 He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to
08054 speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.
08055 
08056 Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.
08057 
08058 No fear: no brains.
08059 
08060 Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.
08061 
08062 He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that
08063 boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello
08064 barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he
08065 was telling me...
08066 
08067 Hope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.
08068 
08069 For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God
08070 till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a
08071 hairy chap.
08072 
08073 Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,
08074 cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose
08075 smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat
08076 on the parsnips.
08077 
08078 And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give
08079 us a good one for the Gold cup?
08080 
08081 I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a
08082 horse.
08083 
08084 You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.
08085 
08086 Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of
08087 disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his
08088 wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather
08089 with the chill off.
08090 
08091 Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like
08092 the way it curves there.
08093 
08094 I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined
08095 many a man, the same horses.
08096 
08097 Vintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits
08098 for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.
08099 
08100 True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's
08101 no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving
08102 Sceptre today. Zinfandel's the favourite, lord Howard de Walden's, won
08103 at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one
08104 against Saint Amant a fortnight before.
08105 
08106 That so? Davy Byrne said...
08107 
08108 He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned
08109 its pages.
08110 
08111 I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of
08112 horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,
08113 Rothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow
08114 cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off it.
08115 Ay.
08116 
08117 He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the
08118 flutes.
08119 
08120 Ay, he said, sighing.
08121 
08122 Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.
08123 Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him
08124 forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again.
08125 Cold nose he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly
08126 beards they like. Dogs' cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling
08127 stomach's Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her
08128 lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!
08129 
08130 Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish
08131 cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath
08132 of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can.
08133 Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She...
08134 
08135 Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so
08136 off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy
08137 lobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of
08138 shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the
08139 French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing
08140 in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything into your
08141 mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good.
08142 Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it
08143 on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit.
08144 Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial
08145 irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like
08146 a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them
08147 out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect
08148 on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he
08149 oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has
08150 no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game.
08151 Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old,
08152 blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might
08153 mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no
08154 yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the
08155 scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats,
08156 then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour.
08157 Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in
08158 the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the
08159 grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom
08160 pearls. The _ilite. Crhme de la crhme_. They want special dishes to
08161 pretend they're. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings
08162 of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff,
08163 Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send
08164 him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the
08165 Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted _chef_ like a rabbi. Combustible duck.
08166 Curly cabbage _` la duchesse de Parme_. Just as well to write it on the
08167 bill of fare so you can know what you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the
08168 broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese
08169 stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan.
08170 Wouldn't mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress,
08171 halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole,
08172 miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect
08173 that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. _Du, de la_ French.
08174 Still it's the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped
08175 the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills
08176 can't write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape
08177 with his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of
08178 brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.
08179 
08180 Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.
08181 
08182 Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress
08183 grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me
08184 memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns
08185 on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple
08186 by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton.
08187 Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.
08188 Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub
08189 my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with
08190 ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn
08191 away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.
08192 Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.
08193 Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate
08194 it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky
08195 gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles
08196 fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a
08197 nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns
08198 she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips,
08199 her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts full in her blouse of nun's
08200 veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was
08201 kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.
08202 
08203 Me. And me now.
08204 
08205 Stuck, the flies buzzed.
08206 
08207 His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty:
08208 it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the
08209 world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall,
08210 naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what man looks. All
08211 to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she
08212 did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in
08213 your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all
08214 ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and
08215 turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods'
08216 food. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we
08217 stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung,
08218 earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never
08219 looked. I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something drop
08220 see if she.
08221 
08222 Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to
08223 do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and
08224 walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men
08225 lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.
08226 
08227 When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:
08228 
08229 What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?
08230 
08231 He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for
08232 the _Freeman._
08233 
08234 I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?
08235 
08236 Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?
08237 
08238 I noticed he was in mourning.
08239 
08240 Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at
08241 home. You're right, by God. So he was.
08242 
08243 I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a
08244 gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their
08245 minds.
08246 
08247 It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before
08248 yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's
08249 wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home
08250 to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.
08251 
08252 And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.
08253 
08254 Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.
08255 
08256 He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of
08257 that.
08258 
08259 How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.
08260 
08261 Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He
08262 winked.
08263 
08264 He's in the craft, he said.
08265 
08266 Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.
08267 
08268 Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He's
08269 an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg
08270 up. I was told that by a--well, I won't say who.
08271 
08272 Is that a fact?
08273 
08274 O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're
08275 down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they're as close as
08276 damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.
08277 
08278 Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
08279 
08280 Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!
08281 
08282 There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find
08283 out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and
08284 swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint
08285 Legers of Doneraile.
08286 
08287 Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
08288 
08289 And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here
08290 and I never once saw him--you know, over the line.
08291 
08292 God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips
08293 off when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch? Ah,
08294 you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does
08295 he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he
08296 does.
08297 
08298 There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.
08299 
08300 He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He's been known
08301 to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O,
08302 Bloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.
08303 
08304 His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.
08305 
08306 I know, Davy Byrne said.
08307 
08308 Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.
08309 
08310 Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,
08311 a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.
08312 
08313 Day, Mr Byrne.
08314 
08315 Day, gentlemen.
08316 
08317 They paused at the counter.
08318 
08319 Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.
08320 
08321 I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.
08322 
08323 Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.
08324 
08325 I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
08326 
08327 How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God' sake? What's
08328 yours, Tom?
08329 
08330 How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.
08331 
08332 For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and
08333 hiccupped.
08334 
08335 Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.
08336 
08337 Certainly, sir.
08338 
08339 Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.
08340 
08341 Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold
08342 water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.
08343 He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.
08344 
08345 Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.
08346 
08347 Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before
08348 him.
08349 
08350 That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.
08351 
08352 Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.
08353 
08354 Tom Rochford nodded and drank.
08355 
08356 Is it Zinfandel?
08357 
08358 Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on my
08359 own.
08360 
08361 Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard
08362 said. Who gave it to you?
08363 
08364 Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.
08365 
08366 So long! Nosey Flynn said.
08367 
08368 The others turned.
08369 
08370 That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
08371 
08372 Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two
08373 of your small Jamesons after that and a...
08374 
08375 Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.
08376 
08377 Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.
08378 
08379 Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
08380 smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with
08381 those Rontgen rays searchlight you could.
08382 
08383 At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
08384 cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks
08385 having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom
08386 coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move.
08387 Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?
08388 Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long mouths.
08389 Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent
08390 free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.
08391 
08392 He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
08393 
08394 Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M'invitasti._
08395 
08396 Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap
08397 in the blues. Dutch courage. That _Kilkenny People_ in the national
08398 library now I must.
08399 
08400 Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber,
08401 turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down,
08402 swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the
08403 body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of
08404 intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the
08405 time with his insides entrails on show. Science.
08406 
08407 A cenar teco._
08408 
08409 What does that _teco_ mean? Tonight perhaps.
08410 
08411      _Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
08412      To come to supper tonight,
08413      The rum the rumdum._
08414 
08415 Doesn't go properly.
08416 
08417 Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten about
08418 two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott's dyeworks
08419 van over there. If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. Five guineas
08420 about. On the pig's back.
08421 
08422 Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new
08423 garters.
08424 
08425 Today. Today. Not think.
08426 
08427 Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,
08428 Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely
08429 seaside girls. Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy
08430 thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.
08431 Will eat anything.
08432 
08433 Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and
08434 passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. _Why I left the church
08435 of Rome? Birds' Nest._ Women run him. They say they used to give pauper
08436 children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.
08437 Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same
08438 bait. Why we left the church of Rome.
08439 
08440 A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No
08441 tram in sight. Wants to cross.
08442 
08443 Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.
08444 
08445 The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He
08446 moved his head uncertainly.
08447 
08448 You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.
08449 Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.
08450 
08451 The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its
08452 line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I
08453 saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in
08454 John Long's. Slaking his drouth.
08455 
08456 There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you
08457 across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?
08458 
08459 Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.
08460 
08461 Come, Mr Bloom said.
08462 
08463 He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to
08464 guide it forward.
08465 
08466 Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust
08467 what you tell them. Pass a common remark.
08468 
08469 The rain kept off.
08470 
08471 No answer.
08472 
08473 Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different
08474 for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like
08475 Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder
08476 if he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired
08477 drudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a
08478 horse.
08479 
08480 Thanks, sir.
08481 
08482 Knows I'm a man. Voice.
08483 
08484 Right now? First turn to the left.
08485 
08486 The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing
08487 his cane back, feeling again.
08488 
08489 Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
08490 tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?
08491 Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense
08492 of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder
08493 would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of
08494 Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk
08495 in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow
08496 going in to be a priest.
08497 
08498 Penrose! That was that chap's name.
08499 
08500 Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.
08501 Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a
08502 deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.
08503 Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People
08504 ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. Hates
08505 sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.
08506 
08507 Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched
08508 together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring,
08509 the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with your
08510 eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no
08511 pleasure.
08512 
08513 And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl
08514 passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have
08515 them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his
08516 mind's eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his
08517 fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,
08518 for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.
08519 Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of
08520 white.
08521 
08522 Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two
08523 shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just here
08524 too. Wait. Think over it.
08525 
08526 With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
08527 his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt
08528 the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.
08529 The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick
08530 street. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling
08531 my braces.
08532 
08533 Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat
08534 and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of
08535 his belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to
08536 see.
08537 
08538 He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.
08539 
08540 Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would
08541 he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being
08542 born that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned
08543 and drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration
08544 for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.
08545 Dear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to
08546 them someway.
08547 
08548 Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. Solemn as Troy.
08549 After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking
08550 a magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat
08551 school. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he'd turn up his nose
08552 at that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a
08553 dusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder's court.
08554 Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their
08555 percentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil
08556 on moneylenders. Gave Reuben J. a great strawcalling. Now he's really
08557 what they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers
08558 in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
08559 
08560 Hello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant.
08561 Sixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer's hospital. _The
08562 Messiah_ was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out
08563 there: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a
08564 leech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.
08565 
08566 Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.
08567 
08568 Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.
08569 
08570 His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to
08571 the right.
08572 
08573 Is it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too
08574 heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.
08575 
08576 Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.
08577 Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?
08578 
08579 Didn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.
08580 
08581 The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold
08582 statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.
08583 
08584 No. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.
08585 
08586 My heart!
08587 
08588 His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas
08589 Deane was the Greek architecture.
08590 
08591 Look for something I.
08592 
08593 His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded
08594 Agendath Netaim. Where did I?
08595 
08596 Busy looking.
08597 
08598 He thrust back quick Agendath.
08599 
08600 Afternoon she said.
08601 
08602 I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. _Freeman._
08603 Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?
08604 
08605 Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.
08606 
08607 His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap
08608 lotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.
08609 
08610 Safe!
08611 
08612 
08613 Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:
08614 
08615 
08616 And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.
08617 A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms
08618 against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in
08619 real life.
08620 
08621 He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step
08622 backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.
08623 
08624 A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a
08625 noiseless beck.
08626 
08627 Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful
08628 ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always
08629 feels that Goethe's judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.
08630 
08631 Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door
08632 he gave his large ear all to the attendant's words: heard them: and was
08633 gone.
08634 
08635 Two left.
08636 
08637 Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes
08638 before his death.
08639 
08640 Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with
08641 elder's gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation? _The Sorrows
08642 of Satan_ he calls it.
08643 
08644 Smile. Smile Cranly's smile.
08645 
08646      _First he tickled her
08647      Then he patted her
08648      Then he passed the female catheter.
08649      For he was a medical
08650      Jolly old medi..._
08651 
08652 I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the
08653 mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.
08654 
08655 Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought
08656 the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed
08657 low: a sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered.
08658 
08659      _Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
08660      Tears such as angels weep.
08661      Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta._
08662 
08663 He holds my follies hostage.
08664 
08665 Cranly's eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed
08666 Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.
08667 And one more to hail him: _ave, rabbi_: the Tinahely twelve. In the
08668 shadow of the glen he cooees for them. My soul's youth I gave him, night
08669 by night. God speed. Good hunting.
08670 
08671 Mulligan has my telegram.
08672 
08673 Folly. Persist.
08674 
08675 Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a
08676 figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare's Hamlet though
08677 I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.
08678 
08679 All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his
08680 shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.
08681 Clergymen's discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal
08682 to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a
08683 work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of
08684 Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley,
08685 the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
08686 wisdom, Plato's world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of
08687 schoolboys for schoolboys.
08688 
08689 A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike
08690 me!
08691 
08692 The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.
08693 Aristotle was once Plato's schoolboy.
08694 
08695 And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One
08696 can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
08697 
08698 He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.
08699 
08700 Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the
08701 heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who
08702 suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon
08703 the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.
08704 
08705 Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name
08706 Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no
08707 secret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching
08708 to see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of
08709 light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the
08710 plane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P.
08711 must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very
08712 illustrious sister H.P.B.'s elemental.
08713 
08714 O, fie! Out on't! _Pfuiteufel!_ You naughtn't to look, missus, so you
08715 naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental.
08716 
08717 Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with
08718 grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.
08719 
08720 That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings about
08721 the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
08722 undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato's.
08723 
08724 John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
08725 
08726 Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
08727 with Plato.
08728 
08729 Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
08730 commonwealth?
08731 
08732 Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of
08733 allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the
08734 street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through
08735 spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after
08736 Blake's buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a
08737 shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to
08738 the past.
08739 
08740 Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.
08741 
08742 Haines is gone, he said.
08743 
08744 Is he?
08745 
08746 I was showing him Jubainville's book. He's quite enthusiastic, don't
08747 you know, about Hyde's _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn't bring him in
08748 to hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.
08749 
08750      _Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick
08751      To greet the callous public.
08752      Writ, I ween, 'twas not my wish
08753      In lean unlovely English._
08754 
08755 The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.
08756 
08757 We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
08758 twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.
08759 
08760 People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
08761 Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the
08762 world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the
08763 hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the
08764 living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the
08765 sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower
08766 of corruption in Mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the
08767 poor of heart, the life of Homer's Phaeacians.
08768 
08769 From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.
08770 
08771 Mallarme, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
08772 poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about
08773 Hamlet._ He says: _il se promhne, lisant au livre de lui-mjme_, don't
08774 you know, _reading the book of himself_. He describes _Hamlet_ given in
08775 a French town, don't you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.
08776 
08777 His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.
08778 
08779      _HAMLET
08780      ou
08781      LE DISTRAIT
08782      Pihce de Shakespeare_
08783 
08784 He repeated to John Eglinton's newgathered frown:
08785 
08786 Pihce de Shakespeare_, don't you know. It's so French. The French
08787 point of view. _Hamlet ou_...
08788 
08789 The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.
08790 
08791 John Eglinton laughed.
08792 
08793 Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but
08794 distressingly shortsighted in some matters.
08795 
08796 Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.
08797 
08798 A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not
08799 for nothing was he a butcher's son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and
08800 spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father's one.
08801 Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to
08802 shoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the
08803 concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.
08804 
08805 Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.
08806 
08807 Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none But we had spared..._
08808 
08809 Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.
08810 
08811 He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said
08812 for Mr Best's behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our
08813 flesh creep.
08814 
08815 List! List! O List!_
08816 
08817 My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.
08818 
08819 If thou didst ever..._
08820 
08821 What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded
08822 into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
08823 manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
08824 lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning
08825 to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?
08826 
08827 John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.
08828 
08829 Lifted.
08830 
08831 It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with
08832 a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the
08833 bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.
08834 Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the
08835 groundlings.
08836 
08837 Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.
08838 
08839 Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks
08840 by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the
08841 pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon
08842 has other thoughts.
08843 
08844 Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
08845 
08846 The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
08847 castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the
08848 ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who
08849 has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in
08850 order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage,
08851 the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth,
08852 calling him by a name:
08853 
08854 Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit,_
08855 
08856 bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
08857 young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
08858 died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.
08859 
08860 Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
08861 the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
08862 to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
08863 prince Hamlet's twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
08864 he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you
08865 are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the
08866 guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?
08867 
08868 But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
08869 impatiently.
08870 
08871 Art thou there, truepenny?
08872 
08873 Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I
08874 mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the
08875 poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
08876 l'Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,
08877 the poet's drinking, the poet's debts. We have _King Lear_: and it is
08878 immortal.
08879 
08880 Mr Best's face, appealed to, agreed.
08881 
08882 Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, Mananaan
08883 MacLir..._
08884 
08885 How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?
08886 
08887 Marry, I wanted it.
08888 
08889 Take thou this noble.
08890 
08891 Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson's bed, clergyman's
08892 daughter. Agenbite of inwit.
08893 
08894 Do you intend to pay it back?
08895 
08896 O, yes.
08897 
08898 When? Now?
08899 
08900 Well... No.
08901 
08902 When, then?
08903 
08904 I paid my way. I paid my way.
08905 
08906 Steady on. He's from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe
08907 it.
08908 
08909 Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got
08910 pound.
08911 
08912 Buzz. Buzz.
08913 
08914 But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under
08915 everchanging forms.
08916 
08917 I that sinned and prayed and fasted.
08918 
08919 A child Conmee saved from pandies.
08920 
08921 I, I and I. I.
08922 
08923 A.E.I.O.U.
08924 
08925 Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?
08926 John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid
08927 for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.
08928 
08929 She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She
08930 saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore
08931 his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed
08932 when he lay on his deathbed.
08933 
08934 Mother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into
08935 this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. _Liliata
08936 rutilantium._
08937 
08938 I wept alone.
08939 
08940 John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.
08941 
08942 The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
08943 out of it as quickly and as best he could.
08944 
08945 Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His
08946 errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.
08947 
08948 Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
08949 softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.
08950 
08951 A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
08952 discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn
08953 from Xanthippe?
08954 
08955 Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
08956 into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit
08957 nomen!_), Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever
08958 know. But neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him
08959 from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.
08960 
08961 But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem
08962 to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.
08963 
08964 His look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to
08965 chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless
08966 though maligned.
08967 
08968 He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.
08969 He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
08970 The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we should
08971 know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds,
08972 the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, _Venus and
08973 Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.
08974 Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and
08975 beautiful. Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a
08976 passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose
08977 the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her
08978 and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy.
08979 Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He
08980 was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.
08981 By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and
08982 twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
08983 to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford
08984 wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.
08985 
08986 And my turn? When?
08987 
08988 Come!
08989 
08990 Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
08991 brightly.
08992 
08993 He murmured then with blond delight for all:
08994 
08995 Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie._
08996 
08997 Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.
08998 
08999 A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
09000 cooperative watch.
09001 
09002 I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._
09003 
09004 Whither away? Exploitable ground.
09005 
09006 Are you going? John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you
09007 at Moore's tonight? Piper is coming.
09008 
09009 Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?
09010 
09011 Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.
09012 
09013 I don't know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get
09014 away in time.
09015 
09016 Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. _Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali book we
09017 tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an
09018 Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.
09019 The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship,
09020 ringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies
09021 tend them i'the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god,
09022 he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls,
09023 shesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled,
09024 whirling, they bewail.
09025 
09026      _In quintessential triviality
09027      For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt._
09028 
09029 They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian
09030 said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering
09031 together a sheaf of our younger poets' verses. We are all looking
09032 forward anxiously.
09033 
09034 Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,
09035 lighted, shone.
09036 
09037 See this. Remember.
09038 
09039 Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his
09040 ashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with
09041 two index fingers. Aristotle's experiment. One or two? Necessity is that
09042 in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal,
09043 one hat is one hat.
09044 
09045 Listen.
09046 
09047 Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.
09048 Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he? I liked
09049 Colum's _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you
09050 think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: _As in wild earth
09051 a Grecian vase_. Did he? I hope you'll be able to come tonight. Malachi
09052 Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear
09053 Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn's
09054 wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They remind one of Don Quixote and
09055 Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.
09056 Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in
09057 Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the
09058 grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever
09059 sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.
09060 
09061 Cordelia. _Cordoglio._ Lir's loneliest daughter.
09062 
09063 Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.
09064 
09065 Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be
09066 so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...
09067 
09068 O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much
09069 correspondence.
09070 
09071 I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.
09072 
09073 God ild you. The pigs' paper. Bullockbefriending.
09074 
09075 Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too. Are we going to be
09076 read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope
09077 you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.
09078 
09079 Stephen sat down.
09080 
09081 The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:
09082 
09083 Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.
09084 
09085 He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
09086 chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:
09087 
09088 Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?
09089 
09090 Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?
09091 
09092 Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
09093 first a sundering.
09094 
09095 Yes.
09096 
09097 Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,
09098 from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women
09099 he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
09100 bully tapsters' wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack
09101 dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
09102 cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
09103 grave and unforgiven.
09104 
09105 Yes. So you think...
09106 
09107 The door closed behind the outgoer.
09108 
09109 Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
09110 brooding air.
09111 
09112 A vestal's lamp.
09113 
09114 Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do
09115 had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
09116 the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when
09117 he lived among women.
09118 
09119 Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.
09120 Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the
09121 voice of that Egyptian highpriest. _In painted chambers loaded with
09122 tilebooks._
09123 
09124 They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of
09125 death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
09126 their will.
09127 
09128 Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
09129 enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so
09130 much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.
09131 
09132 But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind
09133 of private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean, I don't
09134 care a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty...
09135 
09136 He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
09137 defiance. His private papers in the original. _Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim
09138 in mo shagart_. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.
09139 
09140 Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:
09141 
09142 I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but
09143 I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
09144 Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.
09145 
09146 Bear with me.
09147 
09148 Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
09149 wrinkled brows. A basilisk. _E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca_. Messer
09150 Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.
09151 
09152 As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
09153 from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist
09154 weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where
09155 it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff
09156 time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image
09157 of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination,
09158 when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that
09159 which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the
09160 future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but
09161 by reflection from that which then I shall be.
09162 
09163 Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.
09164 
09165 Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness
09166 might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
09167 the son.
09168 
09169 Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.
09170 
09171 That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.
09172 
09173 John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.
09174 
09175 If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a
09176 drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan
09177 admired so much breathe another spirit.
09178 
09179 The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.
09180 
09181 There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
09182 sundering.
09183 
09184 Said that.
09185 
09186 If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
09187 the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_
09188 look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a
09189 man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
09190 prince of Tyre?
09191 
09192 Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.
09193 
09194 A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.
09195 
09196 The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
09197 quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead
09198 to the town.
09199 
09200 Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. Cypherjugglers
09201 going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good
09202 masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the
09203 sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_. Booted the twain and staved.
09204 
09205 How many miles to Dublin? Three score and ten, sir. Will we be there by
09206 candlelight?_
09207 
09208 Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
09209 period.
09210 
09211 Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
09212 name is, say of it?
09213 
09214 Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
09215 that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's
09216 child. _My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any
09217 man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?
09218 
09219 The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. _l'art d'jtre
09220 grand_...
09221 
09222 Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,
09223 another image?
09224 
09225 Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all
09226 men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus
09227 
09228 
09229 His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
09230 all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The
09231 images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them
09232 grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.
09233 
09234 The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.
09235 
09236 I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
09237 the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George
09238 Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on
09239 Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant. Oddly
09240 enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the
09241 sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own
09242 that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in
09243 harmony with--what shall I say?--our notions of what ought not to have
09244 been.
09245 
09246 Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize
09247 of their fray.
09248 
09249 He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost
09250 love thy man?
09251 
09252 That may be too, Stephen said. There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr
09253 Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because
09254 you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is
09255 a _buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
09256 scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord
09257 of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written
09258 Romeo and Juliet_. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He
09259 was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will
09260 never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game
09261 of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later
09262 undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded
09263 him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there
09264 remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words,
09265 some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow
09266 of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like
09267 fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.
09268 
09269 They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.
09270 
09271 The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
09272 porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot
09273 know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls
09274 with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast
09275 with two backs that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know of were
09276 he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech
09277 his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward.
09278 Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from
09279 Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its
09280 mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up
09281 to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because
09282 loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
09283 personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he
09284 has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by
09285 Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard
09286 only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
09287 consubstantial with the father.
09288 
09289 Amen! was responded from the doorway.
09290 
09291 Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?
09292 
09293 Entr'acte_.
09294 
09295 A ribald face, sullen as a dean's, Buck Mulligan came forward, then
09296 blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.
09297 
09298 You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he
09299 asked of Stephen.
09300 
09301 Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.
09302 
09303 They make him welcome. _Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._
09304 
09305 Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.
09306 
09307 He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,
09308 Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends,
09309 stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on
09310 crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven
09311 and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His
09312 Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead
09313 when all the quick shall be dead already.
09314 
09315 Glo--o--ri--a in ex--cel--sis De--o.
09316 
09317 He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells
09318 aquiring.
09319 
09320 Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.
09321 Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
09322 Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
09323 
09324 He smiled on all sides equally.
09325 
09326 Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
09327 
09328 Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
09329 
09330 A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
09331 
09332 To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like
09333 Synge.
09334 
09335 Mr Best turned to him.
09336 
09337 Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after at
09338 the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's _Lovesongs of Connacht_.
09339 
09340 I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
09341 
09342 The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
09343 perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played
09344 Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining
09345 held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an
09346 Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He
09347 swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
09348 
09349 The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said,
09350 lifting his brilliant notebook. That _Portrait of Mr W. H._ where he
09351 proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
09352 
09353 For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
09354 
09355 Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
09356 
09357 I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of
09358 course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues,
09359 the colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very
09360 essence of Wilde, don't you know. The light touch.
09361 
09362 His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.
09363 Tame essence of Wilde.
09364 
09365 You're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan
09366 Deasy's ducats.
09367 
09368 How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.
09369 
09370 For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.
09371 
09372 Wit. You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks
09373 in. Lineaments of gratified desire.
09374 
09375 There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime
09376 send them. Yea, turtledove her.
09377 
09378 Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in's kiss.
09379 
09380 Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking.
09381 The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
09382 
09383 They talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.
09384 
09385 Buck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head
09386 wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His
09387 mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
09388 
09389 Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
09390 
09391 He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
09392 
09393 The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the
09394 immense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus. Where did you
09395 launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four
09396 quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram!
09397 Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer!
09398 O, you priestified Kinchite!
09399 
09400 Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a
09401 querulous brogue:
09402 
09403 It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were,
09404 Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did
09405 for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with
09406 leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's
09407 sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.
09408 
09409 He wailed:
09410 
09411 And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your
09412 conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the
09413 drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
09414 
09415 Stephen laughed.
09416 
09417 Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.
09418 
09419 The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He
09420 heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to
09421 murder you.
09422 
09423 Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
09424 
09425 Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping
09426 ceiling.
09427 
09428 Murder you! he laughed.
09429 
09430 Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash
09431 of lights in rue Saint-Andri-des-Arts. In words of words for words,
09432 palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods,
09433 brandishing a winebottle. _C'est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish. His
09434 image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i'the forest.
09435 
09436 Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.
09437 
09438  in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his
09439 Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms... Yes?
09440 What is it?
09441 
09442 There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
09443 offering a card. From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the
09444 Kilkenny People_ for last year.
09445 
09446 Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...
09447 
09448 He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,
09449 asked, creaked, asked:
09450 
09451 Is he?... O, there!
09452 
09453 Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked
09454 with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
09455 honest broadbrim.
09456 
09457 This gentleman? _Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People?_ To be sure. Good
09458 day, sir. _Kilkenny_... We have certainly...
09459 
09460 A patient silhouette waited, listening.
09461 
09462 All the leading provincial... _Northern Whig, Cork Examiner,
09463 Enniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this
09464 gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me...
09465 This way... Please, sir...
09466 
09467 Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
09468 dark figure following his hasty heels.
09469 
09470 The door closed.
09471 
09472 The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
09473 
09474 He jumped up and snatched the card.
09475 
09476 What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
09477 
09478 He rattled on:
09479 
09480 Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the
09481 museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that
09482 has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her.
09483 Life of life, thy lips enkindle._
09484 
09485 Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
09486 
09487 He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker
09488 than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.
09489 Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the
09490 maiden hid_.
09491 
09492 We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval.
09493 We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if
09494 at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
09495 
09496 Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
09497 from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy
09498 in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty
09499 years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary
09500 equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His
09501 art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the
09502 art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar
09503 of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter
09504 Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his
09505 back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had
09506 underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied
09507 there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love
09508 and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham's story of the burgher's
09509 wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard
09510 III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing,
09511 took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate,
09512 answered from the capon's blankets: _William the conqueror came before
09513 Richard III_. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O,
09514 and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is
09515 suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.
09516 
09517 Cours la Reine. _Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries.
09518 Minette? Tu veux?_
09519 
09520 The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of oxford's
09521 mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.
09522 
09523 Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
09524 
09525 Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!
09526 
09527 And Harry of six wives' daughter. And other lady friends from
09528 neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those
09529 twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing
09530 behind the diamond panes?
09531 
09532 Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
09533 he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of
09534 Juno's eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.
09535 Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.
09536 
09537 Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply.
09538 
09539 Whom do you suspect? he challenged.
09540 
09541 Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice
09542 spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.
09543 
09544 Love that dare not speak its name.
09545 
09546 As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
09547 lord.
09548 
09549 Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.
09550 
09551 It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
09552 other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the
09553 stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a
09554 shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two
09555 deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained
09556 yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. Sweet
09557 Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.
09558 
09559 Stephen turned boldly in his chair.
09560 
09561 The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you
09562 deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy
09563 tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
09564 between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those
09565 women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her
09566 poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the
09567 first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
09568 sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use
09569 granddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first.
09570 
09571 O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in
09572 royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her
09573 father's shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he
09574 has commended her to posterity.
09575 
09576 He faced their silence.
09577 
09578      To whom thus Eglinton:
09579      You mean the will.
09580      But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
09581      She was entitled to her widow's dower
09582      At common law. His legal knowledge was great
09583      Our judges tell us.
09584      Him Satan fleers,
09585      Mocker:
09586      And therefore he left out her name
09587      From the first draft but he did not leave out
09588      The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
09589      For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
09590      And in London. And therefore when he was urged,
09591      As I believe, to name her
09592      He left her his
09593      Secondbest
09594      Bed.
09595      _Punkt._
09596      Leftherhis
09597      Secondbest
09598      Leftherhis
09599      Bestabed
09600      Secabest
09601      Leftabed.
09602 
09603 
09604 Woa!
09605 
09606 Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
09607 they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.
09608 
09609 He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms
09610 and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
09611 shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her
09612 his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in
09613 peace?
09614 
09615 It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr
09616 Secondbest Best said finely.
09617 
09618 Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was
09619 smiled on.
09620 
09621 Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.
09622 Let me think.
09623 
09624 Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,
09625 Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays
09626 tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his
09627 dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget
09628 Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.
09629 
09630 Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...
09631 
09632 He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for
09633 a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!
09634 
09635 What? asked Besteglinton.
09636 
09637 William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For
09638 terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...
09639 
09640 Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought
09641 of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands
09642 and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those days._
09643 Lovely!
09644 
09645 Catamite.
09646 
09647 The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
09648 ugling Eglinton.
09649 
09650 Steadfast John replied severe:
09651 
09652 The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake
09653 and have it.
09654 
09655 Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?
09656 
09657 And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his
09658 own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself
09659 a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the
09660 famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship
09661 mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.
09662 He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
09663 his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could
09664 Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to
09665 his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging
09666 and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being plucked
09667 forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with
09668 the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for
09669 witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in _Love's Labour Lost_.
09670 His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking
09671 enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's theory
09672 of equivocation. The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play
09673 Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.
09674 The sugared sonnets follow Sidney's. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise
09675 carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of
09676 Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid
09677 meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.
09678 
09679 I think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of
09680 theolologicophilolological. _Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._
09681 
09682 Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared,'expectantly. Your dean
09683 of studies holds he was a holy Roman.
09684 
09685 Sufflaminandus sum._
09686 
09687 He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French
09688 polisher of Italian scandals.
09689 
09690 A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him
09691 myriadminded.
09692 
09693 Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia
09694 inter multos._
09695 
09696 Saint Thomas, Stephen began...
09697 
09698 Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.
09699 
09700 There he keened a wailing rune.
09701 
09702 Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It's destroyed we are from this day!
09703 It's destroyed we are surely!
09704 
09705 All smiled their smiles.
09706 
09707 Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy
09708 reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different
09709 from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his
09710 wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the
09711 love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some
09712 stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with
09713 avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations
09714 are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the
09715 jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their
09716 affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old
09717 Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly
09718 to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold
09719 tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his
09720 wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his
09721 manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.
09722 
09723 Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.
09724 
09725 Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.
09726 
09727 Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.
09728 
09729 The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's
09730 widow, is the will to die.
09731 
09732 Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.
09733 
09734      _What of all the will to do?
09735      It has vanished long ago..._
09736 
09737 She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the
09738 mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as
09739 rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven
09740 parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her
09741 at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in
09742 which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She
09743 read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the _Merry
09744 Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought
09745 over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches_ and _The most Spiritual
09746 Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_. Venus has twisted her
09747 lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age
09748 of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.
09749 
09750 History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_. The
09751 ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's
09752 worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that
09753 Russell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say
09754 that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man.
09755 I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.
09756 
09757 Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping
09758 with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it
09759 him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a gentleman
09760 to see you. Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter
09761 Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with
09762 a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten
09763 forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.
09764 
09765 Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.
09766 
09767 Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I
09768 touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is
09769 attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.
09770 
09771 A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary
09772 evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death.
09773 If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with
09774 thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_, with
09775 fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then
09776 you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No.
09777 The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to
09778 hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised
09779 that mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first
09780 and last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of
09781 conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an
09782 apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that
09783 mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect
09784 flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably
09785 because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void.
09786 Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. _Amor matris_, subjective and
09787 objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be
09788 a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love
09789 him or he any son?
09790 
09791 What the hell are you driving at?
09792 
09793 I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.
09794 
09795 Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea._
09796 
09797 Are you condemned to do this?
09798 
09799 They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal
09800 annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,
09801 hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,
09802 lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with
09803 grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son
09804 unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases
09805 care. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth
09806 his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.
09807 
09808 In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.
09809 
09810 What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.
09811 
09812 Am I a father? If I were?
09813 
09814 Shrunken uncertain hand.
09815 
09816 Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the
09817 field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of
09818 Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if
09819 the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a
09820 father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet
09821 of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not the
09822 father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt
09823 himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather,
09824 the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was
09825 born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.
09826 
09827 Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly
09828 glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.
09829 
09830 Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.
09831 
09832 Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with
09833 child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The
09834 play's the thing! Let me parturiate!
09835 
09836 He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.
09837 
09838 As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the
09839 forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in
09840 Coriolanus._ His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in
09841 King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the
09842 girls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter's Tale_ are we know.
09843 Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may
09844 guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.
09845 
09846 The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.
09847 
09848 The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with
09849 haste, quake, quack.
09850 
09851 Door closed. Cell. Day.
09852 
09853 They list. Three. They.
09854 
09855 I you he they.
09856 
09857 Come, mess.
09858 
09859 STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his
09860 old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer
09861 one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up
09862 in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The playhouse sausage
09863 filled Gilbert's soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are
09864 recorded in the works of sweet William.
09865 
09866 MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What's in a name?
09867 
09868 BEST: That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going to
09869 say a good word for Richard, don't you know, for my sake. _(Laughter)_
09870 
09871 
09872 BUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_)
09873 
09874      _Then outspoke medical Dick
09875      To his comrade medical Davy..._
09876 
09877 STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,
09878 Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles'
09879 names. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his
09880 brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.
09881 
09882 BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name
09883 
09884 
09885 Laughter)_
09886 
09887 QUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...
09888 
09889 STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,
09890 William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old
09891 Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in
09892 the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o'Gaunt his name
09893 is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend
09894 sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer
09895 than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What's in a name?
09896 That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that
09897 we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth.
09898 It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the
09899 night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent
09900 constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. His
09901 eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as
09902 he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from
09903 Shottery and from her arms.
09904 
09905 Both satisfied. I too.
09906 
09907 Don't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.
09908 
09909 And from her arms.
09910 
09911 Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?
09912 
09913 Read the skies. _Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos._ Where's your
09914 configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: _sua donna.
09915 Gi`: di lui. gelindo risolve di non amare_ S. D.
09916 
09917 What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a
09918 celestial phenomenon?
09919 
09920 A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.
09921 
09922 What more's to speak?
09923 
09924 Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.
09925 
09926 Stephanos,_ my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my
09927 feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.
09928 
09929 You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is
09930 strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.
09931 
09932 Me, Magee and Mulligan.
09933 
09934 Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?
09935 Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.
09936 Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing
09937 be.
09938 
09939 Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:
09940 
09941 That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know,
09942 we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three
09943 brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The
09944 third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best
09945 prize.
09946 
09947 Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.
09948 
09949 The quaker librarian springhalted near.
09950 
09951 I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you
09952 to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps
09953 I am anticipating?
09954 
09955 He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.
09956 
09957 An attendant from the doorway called:
09958 
09959 Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...
09960 
09961 O, Father Dineen! Directly.
09962 
09963 Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.
09964 
09965 John Eglinton touched the foil.
09966 
09967 Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.
09968 You kept them for the last, didn't you?
09969 
09970 In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and
09971 nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A
09972 brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.
09973 
09974 Lapwing.
09975 
09976 Where is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then
09977 Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They
09978 mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.
09979 
09980 Lapwing.
09981 
09982 I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.
09983 
09984 On.
09985 
09986 You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
09987 took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?
09988 Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
09989 what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard
09990 the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The
09991 other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his
09992 kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence,
09993 the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which
09994 Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney's _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a
09995 Celtic legend older than history?
09996 
09997 That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine
09998 a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. _Que
09999 voulez-vous?_ Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes
10000 Ulysses quote Aristotle.
10001 
10002 Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or
10003 the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
10004 Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of
10005 banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
10006 uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero
10007 breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
10008 book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
10009 another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.
10010 It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
10011 daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it
10012 was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
10013 and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of
10014 my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin,
10015 committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the
10016 lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
10017 which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty
10018 and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere in
10019 the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you
10020 like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure for Measure_--and
10021 in all the other plays which I have not read.
10022 
10023 He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.
10024 
10025 Judge Eglinton summed up.
10026 
10027 The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He
10028 is all in all.
10029 
10030 He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.
10031 All in all. In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold. He acts
10032 and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he
10033 kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago
10034 ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.
10035 
10036 Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!
10037 
10038 Dark dome received, reverbed.
10039 
10040 And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When
10041 all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _phre?)_ is right. After God
10042 Shakespeare has created most.
10043 
10044 Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after
10045 a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
10046 always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of
10047 life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The
10048 motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet _(phre?)_ and Hamlet _fils._
10049 A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what
10050 though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,
10051 Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom
10052 they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it:
10053 prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of
10054 love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the
10055 place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world
10056 without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck
10057 says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated
10058 on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps
10059 will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through
10060 ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,
10061 widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright
10062 who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light
10063 first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom
10064 the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless
10065 all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
10066 cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there
10067 are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife
10068 unto himself.
10069 
10070 Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried. _Eureka!_
10071 
10072 Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's
10073 desk.
10074 
10075 May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.
10076 
10077 He began to scribble on a slip of paper.
10078 
10079 Take some slips from the counter going out.
10080 
10081 Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,
10082 shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.
10083 
10084 He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.
10085 
10086 Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
10087 variorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._
10088 
10089 You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have
10090 brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe
10091 your own theory?
10092 
10093 No, Stephen said promptly.
10094 
10095 Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a
10096 dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.
10097 
10098 John Eclecticon doubly smiled.
10099 
10100 Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment
10101 for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is
10102 some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man
10103 Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes
10104 that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to
10105 visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor
10106 wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he
10107 believes his theory.
10108 
10109 I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help
10110 me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? _Egomen._ Who to unbelieve? Other
10111 chap.
10112 
10113 You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.
10114 Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an
10115 article on economics.
10116 
10117 Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.
10118 
10119 For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.
10120 
10121 Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
10122 gravely said, honeying malice:
10123 
10124 I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
10125 Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra
10126 Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and
10127 Rosalie, the coalquay whore.
10128 
10129 He broke away.
10130 
10131 Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.
10132 
10133 Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts
10134 and offals.
10135 
10136 Stephen rose.
10137 
10138 Life is many days. This will end.
10139 
10140 We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. _Notre ami_ Moore says
10141 Malachi Mulligan must be there.
10142 
10143 Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.
10144 
10145 Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
10146 Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk
10147 straight?
10148 
10149 Laughing, he...
10150 
10151 Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.
10152 
10153 Lubber...
10154 
10155 Stephen followed a lubber...
10156 
10157 One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His
10158 lub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.
10159 
10160 Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt
10161 head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of
10162 no thought.
10163 
10164 What have I learned? Of them? Of me?
10165 
10166 Walk like Haines now.
10167 
10168 The constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashel Boyle O'Connor
10169 Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet
10170 mad? The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.
10171 
10172 O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...
10173 
10174 Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:
10175 
10176 A pleased bottom.
10177 
10178 The turnstile.
10179 
10180 Is that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...
10181 
10182 The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.
10183 
10184 Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:
10185 
10186 John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won't you wed a wife?_
10187 
10188 He spluttered to the air:
10189 
10190 O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their
10191 playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating a
10192 new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I
10193 smell the pubic sweat of monks.
10194 
10195 He spat blank.
10196 
10197 Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And
10198 left the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born? And his
10199 first child a girl?
10200 
10201 Afterwit. Go back.
10202 
10203 The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,
10204 minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair.
10205 
10206 Eh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...
10207 
10208 Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there...
10209 
10210 Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:
10211 
10212      _I hardly hear the purlieu cry
10213      Or a tommy talk as I pass one by
10214      Before my thoughts begin to run
10215      On F. M'Curdy Atkinson,
10216      The same that had the wooden leg
10217      And that filibustering filibeg
10218      That never dared to slake his drouth,
10219      Magee that had the chinless mouth.
10220      Being afraid to marry on earth
10221      They masturbated for all they were worth._
10222 
10223 
10224 Jest on. Know thyself.
10225 
10226 Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.
10227 
10228 Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing
10229 black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.
10230 
10231 A laugh tripped over his lips.
10232 
10233 Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that
10234 old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you
10235 a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.
10236 Couldn't you do the Yeats touch?
10237 
10238 He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:
10239 
10240 The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.
10241 One thinks of Homer.
10242 
10243 He stopped at the stairfoot.
10244 
10245 I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.
10246 
10247 The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's morrice
10248 with caps of indices.
10249 
10250 In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His
10251 own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three
10252 orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan._
10253 
10254 
10255 He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:
10256 
10257 The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.
10258 
10259 He read, _marcato:_
10260 
10261 Characters:
10262 
10263      TODY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)
10264      CRAB (a bushranger)
10265      MEDICAL DICK )
10266      and          ) (two birds with one stone)
10267      MEDICAL DAVY )
10268      MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)
10269      FRESH NELLY
10270      and
10271      ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).
10272 
10273 He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
10274 and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
10275 
10276 O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to
10277 lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
10278 multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!
10279 
10280 The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted
10281 them.
10282 
10283 About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.
10284 
10285 Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,
10286 if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must
10287 come to, ineluctably.
10288 
10289 My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.
10290 
10291 A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.
10292 
10293 Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.
10294 
10295 The portico.
10296 
10297 Here I watched the birds for augury. Aengus of the birds. They go, they
10298 come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots
10299 after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.
10300 
10301 The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did you
10302 see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient
10303 mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.
10304 
10305 Manner of Oxenford.
10306 
10307 Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.
10308 
10309 A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,
10310 under portcullis barbs.
10311 
10312 They followed.
10313 
10314 Offend me still. Speak on.
10315 
10316 Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail
10317 from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw
10318 of softness softly were blown.
10319 
10320 Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:
10321 from wide earth an altar.
10322 
10323      _Laud we the gods
10324      And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
10325      From our bless'd altars._
10326 
10327 
10328 The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch
10329 in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to
10330 three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again?
10331 Dignam. Yes. _Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the person
10332 to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good
10333 practical catholic: useful at mission time.
10334 
10335 A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
10336 crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the
10337 sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
10338 reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
10339 purse held, he knew, one silver crown.
10340 
10341 Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,
10342 of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
10343 ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words:
10344 If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
10345 abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking
10346 leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
10347 
10348 Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?
10349 
10350 Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton
10351 probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at
10352 Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.
10353 And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to
10354 be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was
10355 very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O,
10356 yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.
10357 
10358 Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
10359 Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.
10360 Yes, he would certainly call.
10361 
10362 Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.
10363 
10364 Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
10365 jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,
10366 in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.
10367 
10368 Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
10369 Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.
10370 
10371 Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?
10372 
10373 A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his
10374 way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.
10375 Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?
10376 
10377 O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.
10378 
10379 Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
10380 square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were
10381 they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his
10382 name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man?
10383 His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.
10384 
10385 Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
10386 pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.
10387 
10388 But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.
10389 
10390 The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
10391 
10392 O, sir.
10393 
10394 Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.
10395 
10396 Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter
10397 to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father
10398 Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
10399 east.
10400 
10401 Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate
10402 frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender
10403 trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave
10404 deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady
10405 Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.
10406 
10407 Was that not Mrs M'Guinness?
10408 
10409 Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
10410 farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and
10411 saluted. How did she do?
10412 
10413 A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to
10414 think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he
10415 say?... such a queenly mien.
10416 
10417 Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup
10418 free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.)
10419 speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say
10420 a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They
10421 acted according to their lights.
10422 
10423 Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular
10424 road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important
10425 thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.
10426 
10427 A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All
10428 raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.
10429 Christian brother boys.
10430 
10431 Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint
10432 Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females.
10433 Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but
10434 occasionally they were also badtempered.
10435 
10436 Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
10437 nobleman. And now it was an office or something.
10438 
10439 Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted
10440 by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father
10441 Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came
10442 from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the
10443 Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
10444 catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually
10445 happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an
10446 act of perfect contrition.
10447 
10448 Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of
10449 which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.
10450 
10451 Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny
10452 Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.
10453 A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
10454 the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee
10455 observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
10456 tubes.
10457 
10458 Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
10459 turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
10460 straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
10461 him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
10462 the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it
10463 out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
10464 people.
10465 
10466 On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis
10467 Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound
10468 tram.
10469 
10470 Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of
10471 saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.
10472 
10473 At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
10474 he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.
10475 
10476 Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
10477 care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence
10478 and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.
10479 Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually
10480 made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The
10481 solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive
10482 for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.
10483 
10484 It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
10485 Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee
10486 supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with
10487 the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,
10488 tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,
10489 sweetly.
10490 
10491 Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that
10492 the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
10493 seat.
10494 
10495 Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
10496 mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.
10497 
10498 At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
10499 woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the
10500 bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and
10501 a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
10502 basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
10503 the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
10504 always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been
10505 absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many
10506 cares, poor creatures.
10507 
10508 From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
10509 Father Conmee.
10510 
10511 Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and
10512 of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of
10513 the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and
10514 yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last
10515 hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit,
10516 Le Nombre des Ilus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those
10517 were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to
10518 whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls,
10519 created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all
10520 be lost, a waste, if one might say.
10521 
10522 At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
10523 conductor and saluted in his turn.
10524 
10525 The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.
10526 The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,
10527 immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.
10528 Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.
10529 Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times
10530 in the barony.
10531 
10532 Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the
10533 Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of
10534 Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.
10535 
10536 A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,
10537 Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
10538 not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the
10539 jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
10540 adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with
10541 her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned
10542 as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.
10543 
10544 Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for
10545 man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.
10546 
10547 Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and
10548 honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
10549 smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
10550 clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
10551 were impalmed by Don John Conmee.
10552 
10553 It was a charming day.
10554 
10555 The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
10556 curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of
10557 small white clouds going slowly down the wind. _Moutonner,_ the French
10558 said. A just and homely word.
10559 
10560 Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
10561 over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
10562 Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard
10563 the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
10564 evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.
10565 
10566 Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An
10567 ivory bookmark told him the page.
10568 
10569 Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.
10570 
10571 Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.
10572 Deus in adiutorium._
10573 
10574 He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
10575 came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:
10576 in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae._
10577 
10578 A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
10579 young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised
10580 his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
10581 detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.
10582 
10583 Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
10584 breviary. _Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
10585 formidavit cor meum._
10586 
10587  * * * *
10588 
10589 Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye
10590 at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,
10591 went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
10592 furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
10593 to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
10594 and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.
10595 
10596 Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.
10597 
10598 Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
10599 downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.
10600 
10601 Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.
10602 
10603 That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.
10604 
10605 Ay, Corny Kelleher said.
10606 
10607 It's very close, the constable said.
10608 
10609 Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
10610 while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a
10611 coin.
10612 
10613 What's the best news? he asked.
10614 
10615 I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with
10616 bated breath.
10617 
10618  * * * *
10619 
10620 A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting
10621 Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards
10622 Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:
10623 
10624 For England_...
10625 
10626 He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
10627 and growled:
10628 
10629 home and beauty._
10630 
10631 J. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the
10632 warehouse with a visitor.
10633 
10634 A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
10635 into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly
10636 at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four
10637 strides.
10638 
10639 He halted and growled angrily:
10640 
10641 For England_...
10642 
10643 Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
10644 gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.
10645 
10646 He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
10647 towards a window and bayed deeply:
10648 
10649 home and beauty._
10650 
10651 The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.
10652 The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card _Unfurnished Apartments_
10653 slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was
10654 seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A
10655 woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the
10656 path.
10657 
10658 One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
10659 minstrel's cap, saying:
10660 
10661 There, sir.
10662 
10663  * * * *
10664 
10665 Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.
10666 
10667 Did you put in the books? Boody asked.
10668 
10669 Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds
10670 twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.
10671 
10672 They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.
10673 
10674 Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles
10675 tickled by stubble.
10676 
10677 Where did you try? Boody asked.
10678 
10679 M'Guinness's.
10680 
10681 Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.
10682 
10683 Bad cess to her big face! she cried.
10684 
10685 Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.
10686 
10687 What's in the pot? she asked.
10688 
10689 Shirts, Maggy said.
10690 
10691 Boody cried angrily:
10692 
10693 Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?
10694 
10695 Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:
10696 
10697 And what's in this?
10698 
10699 A heavy fume gushed in answer.
10700 
10701 Peasoup, Maggy said.
10702 
10703 Where did you get it? Katey asked.
10704 
10705 Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.
10706 
10707 The lacquey rang his bell.
10708 
10709 Barang!
10710 
10711 Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:
10712 
10713 Give us it here.
10714 
10715 Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,
10716 sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her
10717 mouth random crumbs:
10718 
10719 A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?
10720 
10721 Gone to meet father, Maggy said.
10722 
10723 Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:
10724 
10725 Our father who art not in heaven.
10726 
10727 Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:
10728 
10729 Boody! For shame!
10730 
10731 A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
10732 Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed
10733 around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
10734 between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.
10735 
10736  * * * *
10737 
10738 The blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling
10739 fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
10740 and a small jar.
10741 
10742 Put these in first, will you? he said.
10743 
10744 Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.
10745 
10746 That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.
10747 
10748 She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
10749 shamefaced peaches.
10750 
10751 Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
10752 fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
10753 tomatoes, sniffing smells.
10754 
10755 H. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,
10756 plodding towards their goal.
10757 
10758 He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from
10759 his fob and held it at its chain's length.
10760 
10761 Can you send them by tram? Now?
10762 
10763 A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's
10764 cart.
10765 
10766 Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?
10767 
10768 O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.
10769 
10770 The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.
10771 
10772 Will you write the address, sir?
10773 
10774 Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.
10775 
10776 Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.
10777 
10778 Yes, sir. I will, sir.
10779 
10780 Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.
10781 
10782 What's the damage? he asked.
10783 
10784 The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.
10785 
10786 Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took
10787 a red carnation from the tall stemglass.
10788 
10789 This for me? he asked gallantly.
10790 
10791 The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
10792 a bit crooked, blushing.
10793 
10794 Yes, sir, she said.
10795 
10796 Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.
10797 
10798 Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
10799 red flower between his smiling teeth.
10800 
10801 May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.
10802 
10803  * * * *
10804 
10805 Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.
10806 
10807 He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.
10808 
10809 Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,
10810 gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their
10811 stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of
10812 the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.
10813 
10814 Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero
10815 giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo h una bestia.
10816 I peccato. Perchh la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.
10817 Invece, Lei si sacrifica._
10818 
10819 Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in
10820 slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.
10821 
10822 Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. _Ma, dia retta
10823 a me. Ci rifletta_.
10824 
10825 By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram
10826 unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.
10827 
10828 Ci rifletterr,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.
10829 
10830 Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.
10831 
10832 His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously
10833 an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.
10834 
10835 Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. _Venga a trovarmi
10836 e ci pensi. Addio, caro._
10837 
10838 Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand
10839 was freed. _E grazie._
10840 
10841 Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said. _Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!_
10842 
10843 Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,
10844 trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,
10845 signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
10846 implements of music through Trinity gates.
10847 
10848  * * * *
10849 
10850 Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_
10851 far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her
10852 typewriter.
10853 
10854 Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?
10855 Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.
10856 
10857 The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:
10858 six.
10859 
10860 Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:
10861 
10862 16 June 1904.
10863 
10864 Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab
10865 where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L.
10866 Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.
10867 
10868 Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming
10869 soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and
10870 capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking,
10871 is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that
10872 fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a
10873 concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and
10874 all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he
10875 won't keep me here till seven.
10876 
10877 The telephone rang rudely by her ear.
10878 
10879 Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only
10880 those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go
10881 after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and
10882 six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.
10883 
10884 She scribbled three figures on an envelope.
10885 
10886 Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr
10887 Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir.
10888 I'll ring them up after five.
10889 
10890  * * * *
10891 
10892 Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.
10893 
10894 Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?
10895 
10896 Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.
10897 
10898 Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
10899 pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.
10900 
10901 The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
10902 soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and
10903 mouldy air closed round them.
10904 
10905 How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.
10906 
10907 Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic
10908 council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed
10909 himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.
10910 O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.
10911 The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and
10912 the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue
10913 over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?
10914 
10915 No, Ned.
10916 
10917 He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory
10918 serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.
10919 
10920 That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.
10921 
10922 If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to
10923 allow me perhaps...
10924 
10925 Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll
10926 get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here
10927 or from here.
10928 
10929 In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled
10930 seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.
10931 
10932 From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.
10933 
10934 I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass
10935 on your valuable time...
10936 
10937 You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next
10938 week, say. Can you see?
10939 
10940 Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.
10941 
10942 Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.
10943 
10944 He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among
10945 the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey
10946 where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal,
10947 O'Connor, Wexford.
10948 
10949 He stood to read the card in his hand.
10950 
10951 The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint
10952 Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the
10953 Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.
10954 
10955 The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
10956 twig.
10957 
10958 I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.
10959 
10960 Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.
10961 
10962 God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare
10963 after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? _I'm bloody
10964 sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop
10965 was inside._ He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him
10966 anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they
10967 were all of them, the Geraldines.
10968 
10969 The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He
10970 slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
10971 
10972 Woa, sonny!
10973 
10974 He turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:
10975 
10976 Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.
10977 
10978 With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an
10979 instant, sneezed loudly.
10980 
10981 Chow! he said. Blast you!
10982 
10983 The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.
10984 
10985 No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast
10986 your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of
10987 draught...
10988 
10989 He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...
10990 
10991 I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call
10992 him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!
10993 
10994  * * * *
10995 
10996 Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his
10997 claret waistcoat.
10998 
10999 See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.
11000 
11001 He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled
11002 a while, ceased, ogling them: six.
11003 
11004 Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the
11005 consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying
11006 the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the
11007 admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly
11008 female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of
11009 great amplitude.
11010 
11011 See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.
11012 The impact. Leverage, see?
11013 
11014 He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.
11015 
11016 Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late
11017 can see what turn is on and what turns are over.
11018 
11019 See? Tom Rochford said.
11020 
11021 He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:
11022 four. Turn Now On.
11023 
11024 I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good
11025 turn deserves another.
11026 
11027 Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.
11028 
11029 Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin
11030 
11031 Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.
11032 
11033 But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.
11034 
11035 Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.
11036 
11037 He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.
11038 
11039 He's a hero, he said simply.
11040 
11041 I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.
11042 
11043 Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.
11044 
11045 They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
11046 soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.
11047 
11048 Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
11049 Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like
11050 a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half
11051 choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and
11052 all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round
11053 the poor devil and the two were hauled up.
11054 
11055 The act of a hero, he said.
11056 
11057 At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
11058 them for Jervis street.
11059 
11060 This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's
11061 to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and
11062 chain?
11063 
11064 M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's
11065 clock.
11066 
11067 After three, he said. Who's riding her?
11068 
11069 O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.
11070 
11071 While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle
11072 pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy
11073 get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.
11074 
11075 The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
11076 cavalcade.
11077 
11078 Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons
11079 in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an
11080 earthly. Through here.
11081 
11082 They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure
11083 scanned books on the hawker's cart.
11084 
11085 There he is, Lenehan said.
11086 
11087 Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.
11088 
11089 Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.
11090 
11091 He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he
11092 bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were
11093 fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
11094 comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.
11095 
11096 Lenehan laughed.
11097 
11098 I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over
11099 in the sun.
11100 
11101 They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the
11102 riverwall.
11103 
11104 Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's,
11105 carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.
11106 
11107 There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said
11108 eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord
11109 mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan
11110 Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin
11111 Dollard...
11112 
11113 I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.
11114 
11115 Did she? Lenehan said.
11116 
11117 A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number 7
11118 Eccles street.
11119 
11120 He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.
11121 
11122 But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the
11123 catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were
11124 there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to
11125 which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came
11126 solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...
11127 
11128 I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...
11129 
11130 Lenehan linked his arm warmly.
11131 
11132 But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after
11133 all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the
11134 morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's
11135 night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
11136 side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing
11137 glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_. She was well primed
11138 with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the
11139 bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She
11140 has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.
11141 
11142 He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
11143 
11144 I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.
11145 Know what I mean?
11146 
11147 His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in
11148 delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.
11149 
11150 The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey
11151 mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets
11152 in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and
11153 Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was
11154 lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last
11155 she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. _And what star is that,
11156 Poldy?_ says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. _That one, is it?_
11157 says Chris Callinan, _sure that's only what you might call a pinprick._
11158 By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.
11159 
11160 Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.
11161 
11162 I'm weak, he gasped.
11163 
11164 M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan
11165 walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
11166 rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.
11167 
11168 He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one
11169 of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist
11170 about old Bloom.
11171 
11172  * * * *
11173 
11174 Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria
11175 Monk,_ then of Aristotle's _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print. Plates:
11176 infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered
11177 cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All
11178 butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute
11179 somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.
11180 
11181 He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_
11182 by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.
11183 
11184 That I had, he said, pushing it by.
11185 
11186 The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.
11187 
11188 Them are two good ones, he said.
11189 
11190 Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.
11191 He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his
11192 unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.
11193 
11194 On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay
11195 apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.
11196 
11197 Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. _Fair Tyrants_ by James
11198 Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.
11199 
11200 He opened it. Thought so.
11201 
11202 A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.
11203 
11204 No: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.
11205 
11206 He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_. More in her line. Let us see.
11207 
11208 He read where his finger opened.
11209 
11210 All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on
11211 wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!_
11212 
11213 Yes. This. Here. Try.
11214 
11215 Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands
11216 felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabilli._
11217 
11218 Yes. Take this. The end.
11219 
11220 You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.
11221 The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her
11222 queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played
11223 round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly._
11224 
11225 Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._
11226 
11227 Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply
11228 amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched
11229 themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (_for Him! For Raoul!_).
11230 Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).
11231 Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!
11232 
11233 Young! Young!
11234 
11235 An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of
11236 chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in
11237 the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the
11238 admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the
11239 Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal
11240 reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident
11241 and Guarantee Corporation.
11242 
11243 Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
11244 curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
11245 reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the
11246 floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it,
11247 and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.
11248 
11249 Mr Bloom beheld it.
11250 
11251 Mastering his troubled breath, he said:
11252 
11253 I'll take this one.
11254 
11255 The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.
11256 
11257 Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.
11258 
11259  * * * *
11260 
11261 The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell
11262 twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.
11263 
11264 Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the
11265 bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely
11266 curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any
11267 advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.
11268 
11269 The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
11270 
11271 Barang!
11272 
11273 Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.
11274 J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched
11275 necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.
11276 
11277 Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He
11278 halted near his daughter.
11279 
11280 It's time for you, she said.
11281 
11282 Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.
11283 Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
11284 shoulder? Melancholy God!
11285 
11286 Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and
11287 held them back.
11288 
11289 Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine.
11290 Do you know what you look like?
11291 
11292 He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders
11293 and dropping his underjaw.
11294 
11295 Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.
11296 
11297 Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.
11298 
11299 Did you get any money? Dilly asked.
11300 
11301 Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin
11302 would lend me fourpence.
11303 
11304 You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.
11305 
11306 How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.
11307 
11308 Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along
11309 James's street.
11310 
11311 I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?
11312 
11313 I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns
11314 taught you to be so saucy? Here.
11315 
11316 He handed her a shilling.
11317 
11318 See if you can do anything with that, he said.
11319 
11320 I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.
11321 
11322 Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of
11323 them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother
11324 died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from
11325 me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I
11326 was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.
11327 
11328 He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.
11329 
11330 Well, what is it? he said, stopping.
11331 
11332 The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.
11333 
11334 Barang!
11335 
11336 Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.
11337 
11338 The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but
11339 feebly:
11340 
11341 Bang!
11342 
11343 Mr Dedalus stared at him.
11344 
11345 Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to
11346 talk.
11347 
11348 You got more than that, father, Dilly said.
11349 
11350 I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave
11351 you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got
11352 two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
11353 funeral.
11354 
11355 He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.
11356 
11357 Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.
11358 
11359 Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.
11360 
11361 I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell
11362 street. I'll try this one now.
11363 
11364 You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.
11365 
11366 Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk
11367 for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.
11368 
11369 He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.
11370 
11371 The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of
11372 Parkgate.
11373 
11374 I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.
11375 
11376 The lacquey banged loudly.
11377 
11378 Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
11379 mincing mouth gently:
11380 
11381 The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do
11382 anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!
11383 
11384  * * * *
11385 
11386 From the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the
11387 order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street,
11388 past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr
11389 Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other
11390 establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive.
11391 Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those
11392 farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best
11393 gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that
11394 General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And
11395 heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal
11396 thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most
11397 scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the
11398 firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever
11399 allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins.
11400 You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look
11401 at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were
11402 bad here.
11403 
11404 I smiled at him. _America,_ I said quietly, just like that. _What is
11405 it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true?_
11406 That's a fact.
11407 
11408 Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's
11409 always someone to pick it up.
11410 
11411 Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy
11412 appearance. Bowls them over.
11413 
11414 Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
11415 
11416 Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
11417 
11418 Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
11419 Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson
11420 street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built
11421 under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street
11422 club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian
11423 bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he
11424 remembered me.
11425 
11426 Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.
11427 Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
11428 again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
11429 has it.
11430 
11431 North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains,
11432 sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the
11433 ferrywash, Elijah is coming.
11434 
11435 Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.
11436 Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy
11437 body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned
11438 Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn
11439 it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash
11440 like that. Damn like him.
11441 
11442 Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good
11443 drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his
11444 fat strut.
11445 
11446 Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.
11447 Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife
11448 drove by in her noddy.
11449 
11450 Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.
11451 Fourbottle men.
11452 
11453 Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight
11454 burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the
11455 wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn
11456 down here. Make a detour.
11457 
11458 Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by
11459 the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin
11460 Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood,
11461 the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary
11462 bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.
11463 
11464 Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John
11465 Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the
11466 office of Messrs Collis and Ward.
11467 
11468 Mr Kernan approached Island street.
11469 
11470 Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those
11471 reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all
11472 now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No
11473 cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table
11474 by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major
11475 Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.
11476 
11477 Damn good gin that was.
11478 
11479 Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that
11480 sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were
11481 on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that
11482 is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad
11483 touchingly. Masterly rendition.
11484 
11485 At the siege of Ross did my father fall._
11486 
11487 A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,
11488 leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.
11489 
11490 Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.
11491 
11492 His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a
11493 pity!
11494 
11495  * * * *
11496 
11497 Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers
11498 prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust
11499 darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept
11500 on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies,
11501 leprous and winedark stones.
11502 
11503 Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights
11504 shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of
11505 their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest
11506 them.
11507 
11508 She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,
11509 rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed
11510 silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her
11511 hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.
11512 
11513 Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it
11514 and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating
11515 on a stolen hoard.
11516 
11517 And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words
11518 of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat
11519 standing from everlasting to everlasting.
11520 
11521 Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through
11522 Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,
11523 one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.
11524 
11525 The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
11526 powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always
11527 without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I
11528 between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.
11529 Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me
11530 you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A
11531 look around.
11532 
11533 Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say
11534 right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.
11535 
11536 Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against
11537 his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan
11538 boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood
11539 round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed
11540 gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes'
11541 hearts.
11542 
11543 He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.
11544 
11545 Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.
11546 
11547 Tattered pages. _The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Curi of
11548 Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney._
11549 
11550 I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. _Stephano Dedalo,
11551 alumno optimo, palmam ferenti._
11552 
11553 Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet
11554 of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.
11555 
11556 Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses.
11557 Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read.
11558 Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for
11559 white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the
11560 following talisman three times with hands folded:
11561 
11562 Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._
11563 
11564 Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter
11565 Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's
11566 charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your
11567 wool.
11568 
11569 What are you doing here, Stephen?
11570 
11571 Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.
11572 
11573 Shut the book quick. Don't let see.
11574 
11575 What are you doing? Stephen said.
11576 
11577 A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It
11578 glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her
11579 of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a
11580 pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. _Nebrakada femininum._
11581 
11582 What have you there? Stephen asked.
11583 
11584 I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing
11585 nervously. Is it any good?
11586 
11587 My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.
11588 Shadow of my mind.
11589 
11590 He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.
11591 
11592 What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?
11593 
11594 She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.
11595 
11596 Show no surprise. Quite natural.
11597 
11598 Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you.
11599 I suppose all my books are gone.
11600 
11601 Some, Dilly said. We had to.
11602 
11603 She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will
11604 drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,
11605 my heart, my soul. Salt green death.
11606 
11607 We.
11608 
11609 Agenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.
11610 
11611 Misery! Misery!
11612 
11613  * * * *
11614 
11615 Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
11616 
11617 Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
11618 
11619 They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley
11620 brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.
11621 
11622 What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.
11623 
11624 Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with
11625 two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.
11626 
11627 Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?
11628 
11629 O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.
11630 
11631 With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.
11632 
11633 The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just
11634 waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get
11635 him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.
11636 
11637 He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
11638 his neck.
11639 
11640 I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always
11641 doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!
11642 
11643 He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.
11644 
11645 There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.
11646 
11647 Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
11648 crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards
11649 them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.
11650 
11651 As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
11652 
11653 Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.
11654 
11655 Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.
11656 
11657 Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
11658 Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered
11659 sneeringly:
11660 
11661 That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?
11662 
11663 Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
11664 threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.
11665 
11666 He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
11667 from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
11668 
11669 They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.
11670 
11671 Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to
11672 God he's not paid yet.
11673 
11674 And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.
11675 
11676 Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
11677 glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.
11678 
11679 Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a
11680 deep note.
11681 
11682 Aw! he said.
11683 
11684 That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.
11685 
11686 What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?
11687 
11688 He turned to both.
11689 
11690 That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.
11691 
11692 The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
11693 Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by
11694 Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
11695 hurdles.
11696 
11697 Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
11698 his joyful fingers in the air.
11699 
11700 Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to
11701 show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between
11702 Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.
11703 I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost
11704 me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob,
11705 believe you me.
11706 
11707 For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.
11708 
11709 Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
11710 of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
11711 heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.
11712 
11713 What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?
11714 
11715 He has, Father Cowley said.
11716 
11717 Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben
11718 Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the
11719 particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?
11720 
11721 That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a
11722 minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?
11723 
11724 You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
11725 writ where Jacko put the nuts.
11726 
11727 He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.
11728 
11729 Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
11730 glasses on his coatfront, following them.
11731 
11732  * * * *
11733 
11734 The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they
11735 passed out of the Castleyard gate.
11736 
11737 The policeman touched his forehead.
11738 
11739 God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.
11740 
11741 He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
11742 towards Lord Edward street.
11743 
11744 Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above
11745 the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.
11746 
11747 Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father
11748 Conmee and laid the whole case before him.
11749 
11750 You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.
11751 
11752 Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.
11753 
11754 John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
11755 quickly down Cork hill.
11756 
11757 On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
11758 Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.
11759 
11760 The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.
11761 
11762 Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_
11763 office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.
11764 
11765 Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the
11766 five shillings too.
11767 
11768 Without a second word either, Mr Power said.
11769 
11770 Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.
11771 
11772 John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.
11773 
11774 I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.
11775 
11776 They went down Parliament street.
11777 
11778 There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.
11779 
11780 Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.
11781 
11782 Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's
11783 brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.
11784 
11785 John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
11786 the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
11787 uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.
11788 
11789 The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John
11790 Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.
11791 
11792 They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The
11793 empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,
11794 speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
11795 glance.
11796 
11797 And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
11798 life.
11799 
11800 The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.
11801 
11802 Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
11803 greeted.
11804 
11805 Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay
11806 decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
11807 their faces.
11808 
11809 Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he
11810 said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.
11811 
11812 Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
11813 about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted
11814 to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the
11815 macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,
11816 no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little
11817 Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him. Damned Irish language,
11818 language of our forefathers.
11819 
11820 Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.
11821 
11822 Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the
11823 assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his
11824 peace.
11825 
11826 What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.
11827 
11828 Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.
11829 
11830 O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake
11831 till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!
11832 
11833 Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and
11834 passed in and up the stairs.
11835 
11836 Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think
11837 you knew him or perhaps you did, though.
11838 
11839 With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.
11840 
11841 Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
11842 John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.
11843 
11844 Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham
11845 said.
11846 
11847 Long John Fanning could not remember him.
11848 
11849 Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.
11850 
11851 What's that? Martin Cunningham said.
11852 
11853 All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the
11854 cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
11855 harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past
11856 before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders,
11857 leaping leaders, rode outriders.
11858 
11859 What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the
11860 staircase.
11861 
11862 The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
11863 Nolan answered from the stairfoot.
11864 
11865  * * * *
11866 
11867 As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
11868 Panama to Haines:
11869 
11870 Parnell's brother. There in the corner.
11871 
11872 They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose
11873 beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.
11874 
11875 Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.
11876 
11877 Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.
11878 
11879 John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
11880 went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under
11881 its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell
11882 once more upon a working corner.
11883 
11884 I'll take a _milange,_ Haines said to the waitress.
11885 
11886 Two _milanges,_ Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and
11887 butter and some cakes as well.
11888 
11889 When she had gone he said, laughing:
11890 
11891 We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed
11892 Dedalus on _Hamlet._
11893 
11894 Haines opened his newbought book.
11895 
11896 I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all
11897 minds that have lost their balance.
11898 
11899 The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
11900 
11901 England expects_...
11902 
11903 Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.
11904 
11905 You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.
11906 Wandering Aengus I call him.
11907 
11908 I am sure he has an _idie fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin
11909 thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it
11910 would be likely to be. Such persons always have.
11911 
11912 Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.
11913 
11914 They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never
11915 capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
11916 death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.
11917 The joy of creation...
11918 
11919 Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him
11920 this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw.
11921 It's rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
11922 interesting point out of that.
11923 
11924 Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to
11925 unload her tray.
11926 
11927 He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
11928 the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
11929 of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does
11930 he write anything for your movement?
11931 
11932 He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.
11933 Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its
11934 smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
11935 
11936 Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write
11937 something in ten years.
11938 
11939 Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.
11940 Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.
11941 
11942 He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.
11943 
11944 This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't
11945 want to be imposed on.
11946 
11947 Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
11948 ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping
11949 street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_
11950 from Bridgwater with bricks.
11951 
11952  * * * *
11953 
11954 Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard.
11955 Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with
11956 stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's
11957 house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a
11958 blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.
11959 
11960 Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as
11961 Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
11962 Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.
11963 
11964 At the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name
11965 announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
11966 duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth
11967 bared he muttered:
11968 
11969 Coactus volui._
11970 
11971 He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.
11972 
11973 As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
11974 brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
11975 having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly
11976 face after the striding form.
11977 
11978 God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder
11979 nor I am, you bitch's bastard!
11980 
11981  * * * *
11982 
11983 Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
11984 pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been
11985 sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming
11986 dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
11987 MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
11988 sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's.
11989 And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
11990 blooming time and sighing.
11991 
11992 After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,
11993 stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
11994 pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning
11995 Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will
11996 meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty
11997 sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,
11998 that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar
11999 entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master
12000 Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When
12001 is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He
12002 turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry,
12003 his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the
12004 image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One
12005 of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old
12006 fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.
12007 
12008 Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going
12009 for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would
12010 knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for
12011 science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of
12012 him, dodging and all.
12013 
12014 In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and
12015 a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
12016 telling him and grinning all the time.
12017 
12018 No Sandymount tram.
12019 
12020 Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to
12021 his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The
12022 blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
12023 end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow
12024 either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice
12025 I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight.
12026 Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's
12027 name.
12028 
12029 His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
12030 fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they
12031 were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were
12032 bringing it downstairs.
12033 
12034 Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
12035 the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and
12036 heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing
12037 on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for
12038 to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him
12039 again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be
12040 a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw
12041 his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was
12042 Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to
12043 confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.
12044 
12045  * * * *
12046 
12047 William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by
12048 lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal
12049 lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de
12050 Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.
12051 
12052 The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by
12053 obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern
12054 quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the
12055 metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted
12056 him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's
12057 viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B.
12058 L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the
12059 pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with
12060 his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough
12061 more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot
12062 through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the
12063 porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,
12064 Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the
12065 doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the
12066 Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed
12067 her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously
12068 on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall
12069 under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of
12070 liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze,
12071 Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond
12072 quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the
12073 subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low.
12074 His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's
12075 corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived,
12076 mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich
12077 advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each
12078 other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and
12079 Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's
12080 cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style
12081 it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her
12082 Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van
12083 had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.
12084 Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms
12085 John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord
12086 lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable
12087 William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all
12088 times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked
12089 models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_ James. Over against Dame gate
12090 Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom
12091 Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs
12092 quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to
12093 her. A charming _soubrette,_ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and
12094 lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl
12095 of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon
12096 the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck
12097 Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage
12098 over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the
12099 chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's
12100 street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first
12101 French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the
12102 glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings,
12103 stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not
12104 looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King
12105 Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband
12106 back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the
12107 tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast
12108 and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C.,
12109 agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded
12110 white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind
12111 him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite
12112 Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c,
12113 gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.
12114 By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes
12115 and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl's a Yorkshire
12116 girl._
12117 
12118 Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high
12119 action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a
12120 suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute
12121 but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and
12122 the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His
12123 Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of
12124 music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland
12125 laddies blared and drumthumped after the _corthge_:
12126 
12127      _But though she's a factory lass
12128      And wears no fancy clothes.
12129      Baraabum.
12130      Yet I've a sort of a
12131      Yorkshire relish for
12132      My little Yorkshire rose.
12133      Baraabum._
12134 
12135 Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.
12136 Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson,
12137 C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's
12138 hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a
12139 fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons
12140 in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster
12141 street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched
12142 his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master
12143 Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent
12144 with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased
12145 by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to
12146 inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital,
12147 drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind
12148 stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a
12149 brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across
12150 the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding,
12151 Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to
12152 Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted
12153 themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view
12154 with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain.
12155 On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged
12156 punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small
12157 schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired
12158 by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the
12159 prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy
12160 trousers swallowed by a closing door.

12164 Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing Imperthnthn thnthnthn.

12166 Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.

12180 Peep! Who's in the... peepofgold?
12181 
12182 Tink cried to bronze in pity.
12183 
12184 And a call, pure, long and throbbing. Longindying call.
12185 
12186 Decoy. Soft word. But look: the bright stars fade. Notes chirruping
12187 answer.
12188 
12189 O rose! Castile. The morn is breaking.
12190 
12191 Jingle jingle jaunted jingling.

12280 Then not till then. My eppripfftaph. Be pfrwritt.

12282 Done.
12283 
12284 Begin!
12285 
12286 Bronze by gold, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the
12287 crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing
12288 steel.
12289 
12290 Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.
12291 
12292 Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._
12293 
12294 Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.
12295 
12296 When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:
12297 
12298 Look at the fellow in the tall silk.
12299 
12300 Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.
12301 
12302 In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the
12303 sun.
12304 
12305 He's looking. Mind till I see.
12306 
12307 She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against
12308 the pane in a halo of hurried breath.
12309 
12310 Her wet lips tittered:
12311 
12312 He's killed looking back.
12313 
12314 She laughed:
12315 
12316 O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?
12317 
12318 With sadness.
12319 
12320 Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair
12321 behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a
12322 hair.
12323 
12324 Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.
12325 
12326 It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.
12327 
12328 A man.
12329 
12330 Bloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets
12331 of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by
12332 Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.
12333 
12334 The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them
12335 unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And
12336 
12337 There's your teas, he said.
12338 
12339 Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned
12340 lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.
12341 
12342 What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.
12343 
12344 Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.
12345 
12346 Your _beau,_ is it?
12347 
12348 A haughty bronze replied:
12349 
12350 I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
12351 impertinent insolence.
12352 
12353 Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as
12354 she threatened as he had come.
12355 
12356 Bloom.
12357 
12358 On her flower frowning miss Douce said:
12359 
12360 Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself
12361 I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.
12362 
12363 Ladylike in exquisite contrast.
12364 
12365 Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.
12366 
12367 She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered
12368 under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
12369 waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black
12370 satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
12371 seven.
12372 
12373 Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs
12374 ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.
12375 
12376 Am I awfully sunburnt?
12377 
12378 Miss bronze unbloused her neck.
12379 
12380 No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with
12381 the cherry laurel water?
12382 
12383 Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
12384 gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their
12385 midst a shell.
12386 
12387 And leave it to my hands, she said.
12388 
12389 Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.
12390 
12391 Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
12392 
12393 Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that
12394 old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.
12395 
12396 Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
12397 
12398 O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!
12399 
12400 But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.
12401 
12402 Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears
12403 with little fingers.
12404 
12405 No, don't, she cried.
12406 
12407 I won't listen, she cried.
12408 
12409 But Bloom?
12410 
12411 Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:
12412 
12413 For your what? says he.
12414 
12415 Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed
12416 again:
12417 
12418 Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That
12419 night in the Antient Concert Rooms.
12420 
12421 She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.
12422 
12423 Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,
12424 ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!
12425 
12426 Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce
12427 huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
12428 snout in quest.
12429 
12430 O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?
12431 
12432 Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
12433 
12434 And your other eye!
12435 
12436 Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think
12437 Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name.
12438 By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white
12439 under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I
12440 could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son.
12441 He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of
12442 fellows in: her white.
12443 
12444 By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.
12445 
12446 Of sin.
12447 
12448 In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy
12449 your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let
12450 freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,
12451 high piercing notes.
12452 
12453 Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.
12454 
12455 Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
12456 gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
12457 nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping,
12458 her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,
12459 spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,
12460 coughing with choking, crying:
12461 
12462 O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.
12463 With his bit of beard!
12464 
12465 Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
12466 delight, joy, indignation.
12467 
12468 Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.
12469 
12470 Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each
12471 each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,
12472 shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I
12473 knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
12474 pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!),
12475 panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.
12476 
12477 Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.
12478 
12479 O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I
12480 wished
12481 
12482 I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.
12483 
12484 O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!
12485 
12486 And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.
12487 
12488 By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of
12489 their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at
12490 doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want.
12491 Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On.
12492 Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five
12493 guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets
12494 of sin.
12495 
12496 Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.
12497 
12498 Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his
12499 rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.
12500 
12501 O, welcome back, miss Douce.
12502 
12503 He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?
12504 
12505 Tiptop.
12506 
12507 He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.
12508 
12509 Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the
12510 strand all day.
12511 
12512 Bronze whiteness.
12513 
12514 That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed
12515 her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.
12516 
12517 Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.
12518 
12519 O go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.
12520 
12521 He was.
12522 
12523 Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they
12524 christened me simple Simon.
12525 
12526 You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the
12527 doctor order today?
12528 
12529 Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble
12530 you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.
12531 
12532 Jingle.
12533 
12534 With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.
12535 
12536 With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's
12537 she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from
12538 her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought
12539 pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky
12540 fifenotes.
12541 
12542 By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must
12543 be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at
12544 last, they say. Yes. Yes.
12545 
12546 Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the
12547 bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.
12548 
12549 None nought said nothing. Yes.
12550 
12551 Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:
12552 
12553 O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_
12554 
12555 Was Mr Lidwell in today?
12556 
12557 In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex
12558 bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write.
12559 Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on
12560 the rye.
12561 
12562 He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.
12563 
12564 Lenehan came forward.
12565 
12566 Was Mr Boylan looking for me?
12567 
12568 He asked. She answered:
12569 
12570 Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?
12571 
12572 She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her
12573 gaze upon a page:
12574 
12575 No. He was not.
12576 
12577 Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the
12578 sandwichbell wound his round body round.
12579 
12580 Peep! Who's in the corner?
12581 
12582 No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her
12583 stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.
12584 
12585 Jingle jaunty jingle.
12586 
12587 Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice
12588 while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
12589 
12590 Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your
12591 bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?
12592 
12593 He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.
12594 
12595 He sighed aside:
12596 
12597 Ah me! O my!
12598 
12599 He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.
12600 
12601 Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.
12602 
12603 Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.
12604 
12605 Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?
12606 
12607 Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.
12608 
12609 Dry.
12610 
12611 Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.
12612 
12613 I see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is
12614 keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?
12615 
12616 He had.
12617 
12618 I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In
12619 Mooney's _en ville_ and in Mooney's _sur mer._ He had received the rhino
12620 for the labour of his muse.
12621 
12622 He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:
12623 
12624 The _ilite_ of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh
12625 
12626 MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy
12627 of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the
12628 O'Madden Burke.
12629 
12630 After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
12631 
12632 That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.
12633 
12634 He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his
12635 glass.
12636 
12637 He looked towards the saloon door.
12638 
12639 I see you have moved the piano.
12640 
12641 The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
12642 concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.
12643 
12644 Is that a fact?
12645 
12646 Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,
12647 poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.
12648 
12649 Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.
12650 
12651 He drank and strayed away.
12652 
12653 So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.
12654 
12655 God's curse on bitch's bastard.
12656 
12657 Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and
12658 diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.
12659 Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.
12660 
12661 With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for
12662 jinglejaunty blazes boy.
12663 
12664 Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique
12665 triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her
12666 hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt
12667 advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.
12668 
12669 Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in
12670 Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not
12671 happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means
12672 something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is.
12673 Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed
12674 on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke
12675 mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man.
12676 For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a
12677 jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.
12678 
12679 Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.
12680 Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.
12681 
12682 Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.
12683 
12684 Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...
12685 
12686 And four.
12687 
12688 At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go.
12689 Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.
12690 
12691 For men.
12692 
12693 In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.
12694 
12695 From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the
12696 tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now
12697 poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
12698 and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.
12699 
12700 Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and
12701 popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss
12702 
12703 Douce.
12704 
12705 The bright stars fade_...
12706 
12707 A voiceless song sang from within, singing:
12708 
12709  _the morn is breaking._
12710 
12711 A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
12712 hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
12713 called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's
12714 leavetaking, life's, love's morn.
12715 
12716 The dewdrops pearl_...
12717 
12718 Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.
12719 
12720 But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.
12721 
12722 Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.
12723 
12724 She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
12725 dreamily rose.
12726 
12727 Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.
12728 
12729 She answered, slighting:
12730 
12731 Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.
12732 
12733 Like lady, ladylike.
12734 
12735 Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.
12736 Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and
12737 hailed him:
12738 
12739 See the conquering hero comes.
12740 
12741 Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered
12742 hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked
12743 towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.
12744 
12745 And I from thee_...
12746 
12747 I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.
12748 
12749 He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled
12750 on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
12751 hair, a bosom and a rose.
12752 
12753 Smart Boylan bespoke potions.
12754 
12755 What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a
12756 sloegin for me. Wire in yet?
12757 
12758 Not yet. At four she. Who said four?
12759 
12760 Cowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.
12761 
12762 Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.
12763 
12764 Wait.
12765 
12766 Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,
12767 Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there.
12768 See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom
12769 followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.
12770 
12771 Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her
12772 bust, that all but burst, so high.
12773 
12774 O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!
12775 
12776 But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.
12777 
12778 Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.
12779 
12780 Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
12781 lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and
12782 syrupped with her voice:
12783 
12784 Fine goods in small parcels.
12785 
12786 That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.
12787 
12788 Here's fortune, Blazes said.
12789 
12790 He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.
12791 
12792 Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...
12793 
12794 Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.
12795 
12796 Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.
12797 
12798 I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you
12799 know. Fancy of a friend of mine.
12800 
12801 Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's
12802 lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.
12803 
12804 Idolores. The eastern seas.
12805 
12806 Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),
12807 bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.
12808 
12809 Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It
12810 clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till
12811 and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For
12812 me.
12813 
12814 What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?
12815 
12816 O'clock.
12817 
12818 Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes
12819 Boylan's elbowsleeve.
12820 
12821 Let's hear the time, he said.
12822 
12823 The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.
12824 Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near
12825 the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come:
12826 whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.
12827 
12828 Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.
12829 
12830 Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.
12831 
12832  _to Flora's lips did hie._
12833 
12834 High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.
12835 
12836 Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought
12837 
12838 Blazes Boylan's flower and eyes.
12839 
12840 Please, please.
12841 
12842 He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.
12843 
12844 I could not leave thee_...
12845 
12846 Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.
12847 
12848 No, now, urged Lenehan. _Sonnezlacloche!_ O do! There's no-one.
12849 
12850 She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling
12851 faces watched her bend.
12852 
12853 Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
12854 and lost and found it, faltering.
12855 
12856 Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_
12857 
12858 Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted
12859 them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.
12860 
12861 Sonnez!_
12862 
12863 Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
12864 smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.
12865 
12866 La Cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust
12867 there.
12868 
12869 She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward
12870 gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
12871 
12872 You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
12873 
12874 Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his
12875 chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound
12876 eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by
12877 mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering,
12878 a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.
12879 
12880 Yes, bronze from anearby.
12881 
12882  _Sweetheart, goodbye!_
12883 
12884 I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.
12885 
12886 He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
12887 
12888 Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.
12889 
12890 Tom Rochford...
12891 
12892 Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
12893 
12894 Lenehan gulped to go.
12895 
12896 Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.
12897 
12898 He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
12899 threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
12900 
12901 How do you do, Mr Dollard?
12902 
12903 Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an
12904 instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob.
12905 Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in
12906 that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.
12907 
12908 Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.
12909 
12910 Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a
12911 ditty. We heard the piano.
12912 
12913 Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie.
12914 And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How
12915 warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me
12916 see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.
12917 
12918 What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.
12919 
12920 Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.
12921 
12922 He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:
12923 hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His
12924 gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.
12925 
12926 Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted
12927 Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.
12928 
12929 Jingle a tinkle jaunted.
12930 
12931 Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom
12932 sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle.
12933 Hear.
12934 
12935 Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.
12936 
12937 Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten
12938 by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light),
12939 she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive
12940 why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where
12941 bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite
12942 nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de
12943 Nil._
12944 
12945 Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded
12946 them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the
12947 Collard grand.
12948 
12949 There was.
12950 
12951 A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him.
12952 He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.
12953 
12954 God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the
12955 punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.
12956 
12957 They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding
12958 garment.
12959 
12960 Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's
12961 my pipe, by the way?
12962 
12963 He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two
12964 diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.
12965 
12966 I saved the situation, Ben, I think.
12967 
12968 You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too.
12969 That was a brilliant idea, Bob.
12970 
12971 Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa.
12972 Tight trou. Brilliant ide.
12973 
12974 I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in
12975 the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and
12976 who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you
12977 remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the
12978 chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad
12979 visage wondering.
12980 
12981 By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.
12982 
12983 Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.
12984 
12985 Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He
12986 wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats
12987 and boleros and trunkhose. What?
12988 
12989 Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of
12990 all descriptions.
12991 
12992 Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.
12993 
12994 Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.
12995 
12996 Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice
12997 name he.
12998 
12999 What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...
13000 
13001 Tweedy.
13002 
13003 Yes. Is she alive?
13004 
13005 And kicking.
13006 
13007 She was a daughter of...
13008 
13009 Daughter of the regiment.
13010 
13011 Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.
13012 
13013 Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
13014 
13015 Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?
13016 
13017 Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.
13018 
13019 Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My
13020 Irish Molly, O.
13021 
13022 He puffed a pungent plumy blast.
13023 
13024 From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.
13025 
13026 They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze
13027 by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,
13028 Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.
13029 
13030 Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he
13031 ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while
13032 Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney,
13033 bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.
13034 
13035 Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.
13036 
13037 By Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in
13038 heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:
13039 sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the?
13040 Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.
13041 
13042 Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding
13043 chords:
13044 
13045 When love absorbs my ardent soul_...
13046 
13047 Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.
13048 
13049 War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.
13050 
13051 So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or
13052 money.
13053 
13054 He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.
13055 
13056 Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said
13057 through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.
13058 
13059 In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.
13060 
13061 Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben.
13062 Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.
13063 
13064 Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She
13065 passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.
13066 They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?
13067 And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would
13068 be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about
13069 her outspread _Independent,_ searching, the lord lieutenant, her
13070 pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble,
13071 first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord
13072 lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.
13073 
13074      --............ _my ardent soul_
13075      _I care not foror the morrow._
13076 
13077 In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is.
13078 Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit
13079 for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers.
13080 Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed,
13081 screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above,
13082 I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many!
13083 Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance
13084 eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical.
13085 Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.
13086 
13087 Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George
13088 Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a
13089 lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old
13090 dingdong again.
13091 
13092 Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.
13093 
13094 George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.
13095 
13096 Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the
13097 Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables,
13098 flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do.
13099 Best value in Dub.
13100 
13101 Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,
13102 mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the
13103 bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore.
13104 Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between
13105 the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's
13106 legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.
13107 
13108 Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.
13109 
13110 Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a
13111 lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that
13112 once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their
13113 harps. I. He. Old. Young.
13114 
13115 Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.
13116 
13117 Strongly.
13118 
13119 Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.
13120 
13121 M'appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.
13122 
13123 Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long
13124 arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he
13125 sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a ship, a
13126 sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the
13127 wind upon the headland, wind around her.
13128 
13129 Cowley sang:
13130 
13131      _--M'appari tutt'amor:
13132      Il mio sguardo l'incontr..._
13133 
13134 She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to
13135 wind, love, speeding sail, return.
13136 
13137 Go on, Simon.
13138 
13139 Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...
13140 
13141 Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,
13142 touched the obedient keys.
13143 
13144 No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.
13145 
13146 The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.
13147 
13148 Up stage strode Father Cowley.
13149 
13150 Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.
13151 
13152 By Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged.
13153 Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom
13154 and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.
13155 
13156 Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He
13157 heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way.
13158 Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.
13159 Never forget it. Never.
13160 
13161 Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.
13162 Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the
13163 piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile.
13164 Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to
13165 the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him.
13166 Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry
13167 water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign
13168 in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed
13169 refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.
13170 
13171 Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the
13172 gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.
13173 
13174 Speech paused on Richie's lips.
13175 
13176 Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.
13177 
13178 Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good
13179 memory.
13180 
13181 Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.
13182 
13183 All is lost now_.
13184 
13185 Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee
13186 murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth
13187 he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two
13188 notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my
13189 motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all.
13190 Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he
13191 whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.
13192 
13193 Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.
13194 Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence
13195 in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call
13196 name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's
13197 why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.
13198 
13199 A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.
13200 
13201 Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.
13202 
13203 He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise
13204 child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?
13205 
13206 Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking
13207 Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his
13208 eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I
13209 did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.
13210 
13211 Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably.
13212 Stopped again.
13213 
13214 Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.
13215 
13216 With it, Simon.
13217 
13218 It, Simon.
13219 
13220 Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind
13221 solicitations.
13222 
13223 It, Simon.
13224 
13225 I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall
13226 endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.
13227 
13228 By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a
13229 lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina
13230 to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.
13231 
13232 The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant,
13233 drew a voice away.
13234 
13235 When first I saw that form endearing_...
13236 
13237 Richie turned.
13238 
13239 Si Dedalus' voice, he said.
13240 
13241 Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow
13242 endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to
13243 Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the
13244 bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting
13245 to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.
13246 
13247 Sorrow from me seemed to depart._
13248 
13249 Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves
13250 in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem
13251 dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their
13252 each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each
13253 seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw,
13254 lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect
13255 it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.
13256 
13257 Love that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the
13258 elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet _sonnez la_ gold. Bloom
13259 wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound
13260 it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.
13261 
13262 Full of hope and all delighted_...
13263 
13264 Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his
13265 feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He
13266 can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.
13267 What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last
13268 look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How
13269 do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,
13270 in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.
13271 
13272 Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.
13273 
13274 But alas, 'twas idle dreaming_...
13275 
13276 Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly
13277 man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out
13278 his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he
13279 doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing
13280 too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind
13281 soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.
13282 
13283 Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the chat.
13284 Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.
13285 
13286 Words? Music? No: it's what's behind.
13287 
13288 Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.
13289 
13290 Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music
13291 out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her
13292 tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy
13293 the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood,
13294 gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.
13295 
13296  _ray of hope is_...
13297 
13298 Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse
13299 unsqueaked a ray of hopk.
13300 
13301 Martha_ it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song.
13302 Lovely name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her
13303 heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still
13304 the name: Martha. How strange! Today.
13305 
13306 The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to
13307 Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to
13308 wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,
13309 how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.
13310 
13311 Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in
13312 Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still
13313 hear it better here than in the bar though farther.
13314 
13315 Each graceful look_...
13316 
13317 First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow,
13318 black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.
13319 Fate.
13320 
13321 Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she
13322 sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.
13323 
13324 Charmed my eye_...
13325 
13326 Singing. _Waiting_ she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume
13327 of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat
13328 warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy
13329 eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in
13330 shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.
13331 
13332 Martha! Ah, Martha!_
13333 
13334 Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant
13335 to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In
13336 cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For
13337 only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where.
13338 Somewhere.
13339 
13340      --_Co-ome, thou lost one!
13341      Co-ome, thou dear one!_
13342 
13343 Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!
13344 
13345 Come!_
13346 
13347 It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb
13348 it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too
13349 long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent,
13350 aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the
13351 etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all
13352 soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...
13353 
13354 To me!_
13355 
13356 Siopold!
13357 
13358 Consumed.
13359 
13360 Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her,
13361 you too, me, us.
13362 
13363 Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap
13364 clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said,
13365 cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina
13366 Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank
13367 and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.
13368 
13369 Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before.
13370 Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson,
13371 reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now.
13372 Atrot, in heat, heatseated. _Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la._
13373 Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too
13374 slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.
13375 
13376 An afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.
13377 
13378 And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank,
13379 Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two
13380 more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving,
13381 coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.
13382 
13383 Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd
13384 sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.
13385 
13386 Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy
13387 served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired,
13388 admired. But Bloom sang dumb.
13389 
13390 Admiring.
13391 
13392 Richie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered
13393 one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang _'Twas rank and
13394 fame_: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a
13395 note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so clear
13396 so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice lives not
13397 ask Lambert he can tell you too.
13398 
13399 Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the
13400 night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang _'Twas rank and fame._
13401 
13402 He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of
13403 the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing 'TWAS RANK AND FAME in
13404 his, Ned Lambert's, house.
13405 
13406 Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the
13407 lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more.
13408 The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful,
13409 more than all others.
13410 
13411 That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you
13412 feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.
13413 
13414 Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the
13415 slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While
13416 Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan,
13417 harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening
13418 Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While
13419 big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he
13420 smoked, who smoked.
13421 
13422 Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his
13423 string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on.
13424 Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat.
13425 Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling! Five bob I gave.
13426 Corpus paradisum._ Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone.
13427 They sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get
13428 tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her
13429 wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:'d.
13430 
13431 Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in
13432 your? Twang. It snapped.
13433 
13434 Jingle into Dorset street.
13435 
13436 Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.
13437 
13438 Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.
13439 
13440 George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.
13441 
13442 First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And
13443 second tankard told her so. That that was so.
13444 
13445 Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not
13446 believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first:
13447 gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell:
13448 the tank.
13449 
13450 Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.
13451 
13452 Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A
13453 pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.
13454 
13455 Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is.
13456 Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who
13457 is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper,
13458 envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.
13459 
13460 Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.
13461 
13462 It is, Bloom said.
13463 
13464 Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two
13465 divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two
13466 plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always
13467 find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't
13468 see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you
13469 think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like:
13470 Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite
13471 flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.
13472 
13473 Instance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you
13474 hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear
13475 chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels,
13476 through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood
13477 you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls
13478 learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos
13479 for that. _Blumenlied_ I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow,
13480 a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia
13481 street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.
13482 
13483 Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite
13484 flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.
13485 
13486 It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a
13487 boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles.
13488 Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the
13489 moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such
13490 music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.
13491 
13492 Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a
13493 moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.
13494 
13495 Down the edge of his _Freeman_ baton ranged Bloom's, your other eye,
13496 scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick.
13497 Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...
13498 
13499 Hope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his _Freeman._
13500 Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear
13501 sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I
13502 put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline _imposs._ To write
13503 today.
13504 
13505 Bore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting
13506 fingers on flat pad Pat brought.
13507 
13508 On. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres
13509 enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the
13510 gulls. Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a
13511 crown. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you
13512 despise? Jingle, have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught?
13513 You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes,
13514 yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other
13515 world she wrote. My patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must
13516 believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is. True.
13517 
13518 Folly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives.
13519 Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she
13520 found out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If
13521 they don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.
13522 
13523 A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James
13524 of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young
13525 gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George
13526 Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing
13527 a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great
13528 Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and
13529 jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a
13530 gallantbuttocked mare.
13531 
13532 Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.
13533 
13534 Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.
13535 
13536 Bloom mur: best references. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. You
13537 know how. In haste. Henry. Greek ee. Better add postscript. What is he
13538 playing now? Improvising. Intermezzo. P. S. The rum tum tum. How will
13539 you pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I want
13540 to. Know. O. Course if I didn't I wouldn't ask. La la la ree. Trails off
13541 there sad in minor. Why minor sad? Sign H. They like sad tail at end. P.
13542 P. S. La la la ree. I feel so sad today. La ree. So lonely. Dee.

13544 He blotted quick on pad of Pat. Envel. Address. Just copy out of paper.
13545 Murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. Henry wrote:

13549 Blot over the other so he can't read. There. Right. Idea prize titbit.
13550 Something detective read off blottingpad. Payment at the rate of guinea
13551 per col. Matcham often thinks the laughing witch. Poor Mrs Purefoy. U.
13552 P: up.
13553 
13554 Too poetical that about the sad. Music did that. Music hath charms.
13555 Shakespeare said. Quotations every day in the year. To be or not to be.
13556 Wisdom while you wait.
13557 
13558 In Gerard's rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. One life is
13559 all. One body. Do. But do.
13560 
13561 Done anyhow. Postal order, stamp. Postoffice lower down. Walk now.
13562 Enough. Barney Kiernan's I promised to meet them. Dislike that job.
13563 
13564 House of mourning. Walk. Pat! Doesn't hear. Deaf beetle he is.
13565 
13566 Car near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins.
13567 Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Paint face behind on him then
13568 he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep my mind off.
13569 
13570 Bald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins. Pat is a waiter hard of his
13571 hearing. Pat is a waiter who waits while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. He
13572 waits while you wait. Hee hee. A waiter is he. Hee hee hee hee. He waits
13573 while you wait. While you wait if you wait he will wait while you wait.
13574 Hee hee hee hee. Hoh. Wait while you wait.
13575 
13576 Douce now. Douce Lydia. Bronze and rose.
13577 
13578 She had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell
13579 she brought.
13580 
13581 To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding
13582 seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.
13583 
13584 Listen! she bade him.
13585 
13586 Under Tom Kernan's ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow.
13587 Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband
13588 took him by the throat. _Scoundrel,_ said he, _You'll sing no more
13589 lovesongs._ He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom.
13590 Cowley lay back.
13591 
13592 Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard.
13593 
13594 Wonderful. She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale
13595 gold in contrast glided. To hear.
13596 
13597 Tap.
13598 
13599 Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more
13600 faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for
13601 other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.
13602 
13603 Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.
13604 
13605 Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside.
13606 Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream
13607 first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget.
13608 Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with
13609 seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the
13610 mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave.
13611 No admittance except on business.
13612 
13613 The sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in
13614 the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.
13615 
13616 Wonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur,
13617 hearing: then laid it by, gently.
13618 
13619 What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.
13620 
13621 Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.
13622 
13623 Tap.
13624 
13625 By Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan
13626 turned.
13627 
13628 From the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No,
13629 she was not so lonely archly miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know.
13630 Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly
13631 answered: with a gentleman friend.
13632 
13633 Bob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord
13634 has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a
13635 light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling,
13636 and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one:
13637 two, one, three, four.
13638 
13639 Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket,
13640 cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere.
13641 Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of _Don
13642 Giovanni_ he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle
13643 chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating
13644 dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look
13645 at us.
13646 
13647 That's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other
13648 joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows
13649 you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then
13650 know.
13651 
13652 M'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk.
13653 Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage
13654 men's intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open.
13655 Molly in _quis est homo_: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear.
13656 Want a woman who can deliver the goods.
13657 
13658 Jog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue
13659 clocks came light to earth.
13660 
13661 O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that.
13662 It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is.
13663 Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the
13664 resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to
13665 the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian,
13666 gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle.
13667 Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.
13668 
13669 One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock
13670 with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.
13671 
13672 Tap.
13673 
13674 Qui sdegno,_ Ben, said Father Cowley.
13675 
13676 No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. _The Croppy Boy._ Our native Doric.
13677 
13678 Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.
13679 
13680 Do, do, they begged in one.
13681 
13682 I'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To
13683 me. How much?
13684 
13685 What key? Six sharps?
13686 
13687 F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.
13688 
13689 Bob Cowley's outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.
13690 
13691 Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got
13692 money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears
13693 lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence
13694 tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting
13695 Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.
13696 
13697 But wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the
13698 dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.
13699 
13700 The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach
13701 and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men
13702 and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.
13703 
13704 Tap.
13705 
13706 Ben Dollard's voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it.
13707 Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big
13708 ships' chandler's business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships'
13709 lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh
13710 home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.
13711 
13712 The priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step
13713 in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.
13714 
13715 Ruin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days
13716 in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.
13717 
13718 The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered
13719 a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them
13720 the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.
13721 
13722 Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in _Answers,_ poets'
13723 picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching
13724 in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee
13725 what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he
13726 has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.
13727 
13728 Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf
13729 Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. The chords harped slower.
13730 
13731 The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous.
13732 Ben's contrite beard confessed. _in nomine Domini,_ in God's name he
13733 knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: _mea culpa._
13734 
13735 Latin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion
13736 corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey,
13737 corpusnomine._ Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.
13738 
13739 Tap.
13740 
13741 They listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well
13742 expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.
13743 
13744 The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed
13745 three times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play.
13746 Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he had
13747 not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.
13748 
13749 Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't
13750 half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.
13751 
13752 Bronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face?
13753 They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.
13754 
13755 Cockcarracarra.
13756 
13757 What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes.
13758 Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked
13759 that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.
13760 Custom his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it sounds.
13761 Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless,
13762 gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile
13763 music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.
13764 
13765 She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show.
13766 Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question.
13767 Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised,
13768 listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down
13769 into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you
13770 must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the
13771 tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!
13772 
13773 All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his
13774 brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of
13775 his name and race.
13776 
13777 I too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No
13778 son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?
13779 
13780 He bore no hate.
13781 
13782 Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old. Big Ben his voice
13783 unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his
13784 pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?
13785 
13786 Ireland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to
13787 speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.
13788 
13789 Bless me, father,_ Dollard the croppy cried. _Bless me and let me
13790 go._
13791 
13792 Tap.
13793 
13794 Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week.
13795 Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those
13796 girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance. Letters
13797 read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's owny Mumpsypum.
13798 Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.
13799 
13800 Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest
13801 rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by
13802 heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.
13803 
13804 Tap. Tap.
13805 
13806 Thrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.
13807 
13808 Blank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it:
13809 page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young.
13810 Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman,
13811 a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I
13812 didn't see. They want it. Not too much polite. That's why he gets them.
13813 Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear.
13814 With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy.
13815 She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish.
13816 Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.
13817 
13818 Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?
13819 
13820 Will? You? I. Want. You. To.
13821 
13822 With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch's
13823 bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live,
13824 your last.
13825 
13826 Tap. Tap.
13827 
13828 Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want
13829 to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs
13830 Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.
13831 
13832 A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly,
13833 hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder
13834 river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red
13835 rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is
13836 life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.
13837 
13838 But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell.
13839 For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though.
13840 Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.
13841 
13842 On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave
13843 it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over
13844 the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and
13845 finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid
13846 so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding
13847 through their sliding ring.
13848 
13849 With a cock with a carra.
13850 
13851 Tap. Tap. Tap.
13852 
13853 I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.
13854 
13855 The chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be. Get out before the
13856 end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass by her. Can leave
13857 that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk,
13858 walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell.
13859 Waaaaaaalk.
13860 
13861 Well, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O'er ryehigh blue.
13862 Ow. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have
13863 sweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card
13864 inside. Yes.
13865 
13866 By deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.
13867 
13868 At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid.
13869 Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to
13870 dolorous prayer.
13871 
13872 By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties,
13873 by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and
13874 faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely
13875 Bloom.
13876 
13877 Tap. Tap. Tap.
13878 
13879 Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe
13880 a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.
13881 
13882 Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway
13883 heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all
13884 treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to
13885 wash it down. Glad I avoided.
13886 
13887 Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you're as good as ever you
13888 were.
13889 
13890 Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad,
13891 upon my soul and honour It is.
13892 
13893 Lablache, said Father Cowley.
13894 
13895 Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed
13896 and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering
13897 castagnettes in the air.
13898 
13899 Big Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.
13900 
13901 Rrr.
13902 
13903 And deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all
13904 laughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.
13905 
13906 You're looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.
13907 
13908 Miss Douce composed her rose to wait.
13909 
13910 Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben's fat back shoulderblade.
13911 Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his
13912 person.
13913 
13914 Rrrrrrrsss.
13915 
13916 Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.
13917 
13918 Richie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly
13919 he waited. Unpaid Pat too.
13920 
13921 Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
13922 
13923 Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.
13924 
13925 Mr Dollard, they murmured low.
13926 
13927 Dollard, murmured tankard.
13928 
13929 Tank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the
13930 tank.
13931 
13932 He murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that
13933 is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it?
13934 Dollard, yes.
13935 
13936 Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely,
13937 murmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And _The last rose of summer_ was a lovely
13938 song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.
13939 
13940 'Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round
13941 inside.
13942 
13943 Gassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J's
13944 one and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street.
13945 Wish I hadn't promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your
13946 nerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth.
13947 That rules the world.
13948 
13949 Far. Far. Far. Far.
13950 
13951 Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
13952 
13953 Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with
13954 sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy
13955 on.
13956 
13957 Tap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.
13958 
13959 Cowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way
13960 only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All
13961 ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty.
13962 You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop.
13963 Fiddlefaddle about notes.
13964 
13965 All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you
13966 never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year.
13967 Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys.
13968 Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or
13969 the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing

13972 
13973 Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.
13974 
13975 Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him
13976 this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam's...
13977 
13978 Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.

13982 Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
13983 
13984 The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.
13985 
13986 O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw,
13987 forgot it when he was here.
13988 
13989 Blind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so
13990 exquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.
13991 
13992 Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!
13993 
13994 'lldo! cried Father Cowley.
13995 
13996 Rrrrrr.
13997 
13998 I feel I want...
13999 
14000 Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap
14001 
14002 Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.
14003 
14004 Under the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last
14005 sardine of summer. Bloom alone.
14006 
14007 Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.
14008 
14009 Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
14010 
14011 Bloom went by Barry's. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had.
14012 Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love
14013 one another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of
14014 attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.
14015 
14016 But for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Mickey
14017 Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after
14018 pig's cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band
14019 part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt them through
14020 life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call
14021 yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.
14022 
14023 Tap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by
14024 Daly's window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn't see)
14025 blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid, coolest whiff of
14026 all.
14027 
14028 Instruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even
14029 comb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in
14030 Lombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its
14031 own, don't you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? _Cloche.
14032 Sonnez la._ Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee. Policeman a whistle.
14033 Locks and keys! Sweep! Four o'clock's all's well! Sleep! All is lost
14034 now. Drum? Pompedy. Wait. I know. Towncrier, bumbailiff. Long John.
14035 Waken the dead. Pom. Dignam. Poor little _nominedomine._ Pom. It is
14036 music. I mean of course it's all pom pom pom very much what they call
14037 da capo._ Still you can hear. As we march, we march along, march along.
14038 Pom.
14039 
14040 I must really. Fff. Now if I did that at a banquet. Just a question of
14041 custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same
14042 he must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap.
14043 Muffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin. O,
14044 the whore of the lane!
14045 
14046 A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day
14047 along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing?
14048 Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn. Who had
14049 the? Heehaw shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any
14050 chance of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with
14051 you in the brown costume. Put you off your stroke, that. Appointment
14052 we made knowing we'd never, well hardly ever. Too dear too near to home
14053 sweet home. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face like dip.
14054 Damn her. O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look in here.
14055 
14056 In Lionel Marks's antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold
14057 dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered
14058 candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might
14059 learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you
14060 don't want it. That's what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants
14061 to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to
14062 charge me for the edge he gave it. She's passing now. Six bob.
14063 
14064 Must be the cider or perhaps the burgund.
14065 
14066 Near bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking
14067 glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia's tempting last
14068 rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth:
14069 Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.
14070 
14071 Tap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.
14072 
14073 Bloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks's window. Robert
14074 Emmet's last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.
14075 
14076 True men like you men.
14077 
14078 Ay, ay, Ben.
14079 
14080 Will lift your glass with us.
14081 
14082 They lifted.
14083 
14084 Tschink. Tschunk.
14085 
14086 Tip. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. He saw not bronze. He saw
14087 not gold. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor Richie
14088 nor Pat. Hee hee hee hee. He did not see.
14089 
14090 Seabloom, greaseabloom viewed last words. Softly. _When my country takes
14091 her place among._
14092 
14093 Prrprr.
14094 
14095 Must be the bur.
14096 
14097 Fff! Oo. Rrpr.
14098 
14099 Nations of the earth._ No-one behind. She's passed. _Then and not till
14100 then._ Tram kran kran kran. Good oppor. Coming. Krandlkrankran. I'm
14101 sure it's the burgund. Yes. One, two. _Let my epitaph be._ Kraaaaaa.
14102 Written. I have._
14103 
14104 Pprrpffrrppffff.
14105 
14106 Done._
14107 
14108 
14109 
14110 I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the
14111 corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along
14112 and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have
14113 the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter
14114 only Joe Hynes.
14115 
14116 Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody
14117 chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?
14118 
14119 Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?
14120 
14121 Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that
14122 fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and
14123 ladders.
14124 
14125 What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.
14126 
14127 Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the
14128 garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane--old Troy was just giving
14129 me a wrinkle about him--lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar
14130 to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a
14131 hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury
14132 street.
14133 
14134 Circumcised? says Joe.
14135 
14136 Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm
14137 hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny
14138 out of him.
14139 
14140 That the lay you're on now? says Joe.
14141 
14142 Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful
14143 debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's
14144 walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.
14145 Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him
14146 to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I'll have
14147 him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a
14148 licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus,
14149 I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. _He drink me my
14150 teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?_
14151 
14152 For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's
14153 parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter
14154 called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty,
14155 esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward,
14156 gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds
14157 avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per
14158 pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal,
14159 at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the
14160 said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value
14161 received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in
14162 weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no
14163 pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or
14164 pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall
14165 be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the
14166 said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the
14167 said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said
14168 vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between
14169 the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one
14170 part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns
14171 of the other part.
14172 
14173 Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.
14174 
14175 Not taking anything between drinks, says I.
14176 
14177 What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.
14178 
14179 Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.
14180 
14181 Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.
14182 
14183 Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.
14184 
14185 Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.
14186 
14187 Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?
14188 
14189 Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.
14190 
14191 What was that, Joe? says I.
14192 
14193 Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to
14194 give the citizen the hard word about it.
14195 
14196 So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the
14197 courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he
14198 has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over
14199 that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a
14200 licence, says he.
14201 
14202 In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There
14203 rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in
14204 life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land
14205 it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the
14206 gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the
14207 grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse
14208 fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to
14209 be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty
14210 trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty
14211 sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic
14212 eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which
14213 that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close
14214 proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs
14215 while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden
14216 ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings,
14217 creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes
14218 voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless
14219 princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth
14220 sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of
14221 the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.
14222 
14223 And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
14224 by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for
14225 that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits
14226 of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain
14227 descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring
14228 foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,
14229 pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,
14230 drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,
14231 York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of
14232 mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red
14233 green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and
14234 chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious,
14235 and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.
14236 
14237 I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you
14238 notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
14239 
14240 And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed
14241 ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers
14242 and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and
14243 Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
14244 various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
14245 heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
14246 premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
14247 cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
14248 champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
14249 pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
14250 vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and
14251 lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the
14252 place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of
14253 milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and
14254 targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds,
14255 various in size, the agate with this dun.
14256 
14257 So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the
14258 citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
14259 bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would
14260 drop in the way of drink.
14261 
14262 There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his
14263 load of papers, working for the cause.
14264 
14265 The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be
14266 a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody
14267 dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a
14268 constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
14269 about a licence.
14270 
14271 Stand and deliver, says he.
14272 
14273 That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.
14274 
14275 Pass, friends, says he.
14276 
14277 Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
14278 
14279 What's your opinion of the times?
14280 
14281 Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to
14282 the occasion.
14283 
14284 I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
14285 fork.
14286 
14287 So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
14288 
14289 Foreign wars is the cause of it.
14290 
14291 And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
14292 
14293 It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.
14294 
14295 Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me
14296 I wouldn't sell for half a crown.
14297 
14298 Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.
14299 
14300 Wine of the country, says he.
14301 
14302 What's yours? says Joe.
14303 
14304 Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.
14305 
14306 Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says
14307 he.
14308 
14309 Never better, _a chara_, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?
14310 
14311 And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck
14312 and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.
14313 
14314 The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was
14315 that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired
14316 freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
14317 deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed
14318 hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his
14319 rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his
14320 body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in
14321 hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).
14322 The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
14323 projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
14324 obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes
14325 in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
14326 dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath
14327 issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth
14328 while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his
14329 formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of
14330 the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and
14331 tremble.
14332 
14333 He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching
14334 to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by
14335 a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of
14336 deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased
14337 in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod
14338 with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same
14339 beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every
14340 movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude
14341 yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of
14342 antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages,
14343 Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill,
14344 Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell,
14345 Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy
14346 Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff,
14347 Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain
14348 Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan,
14349 Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the
14350 Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for
14351 Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap,
14352 The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.
14353 Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir
14354 Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of
14355 Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick
14356 W. Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez,
14357 Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas
14358 Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig
14359 Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly
14360 Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve,
14361 Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama
14362 Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye,
14363 the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah
14364 O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of
14365 acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage
14366 animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was
14367 sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and
14368 spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time
14369 by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of
14370 paleolithic stone.
14371 
14372 So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the
14373 sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as
14374 I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.
14375 
14376 And there's more where that came from, says he.
14377 
14378 Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.
14379 
14380 Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the
14381 wheeze.
14382 
14383 I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
14384 Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.
14385 
14386 Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom,
14387 the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the
14388 prudent soul.
14389 
14390 For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised
14391 organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this
14392 blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. _The Irish Independent,_ if
14393 you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to
14394 the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent,_ and
14395 I'll thank you and the marriages.
14396 
14397 And he starts reading them out:
14398 
14399 Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's
14400 on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright
14401 and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the
14402 late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and
14403 Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,
14404 dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr,
14405 Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat
14406 house, Chepstow...
14407 
14408 I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.
14409 
14410 Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,
14411 Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,
14412 Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown
14413 son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?
14414 
14415 Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had
14416 the start of us. Drink that, citizen.
14417 
14418 I will, says he, honourable person.
14419 
14420 Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.
14421 
14422 Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.
14423 Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.
14424 
14425 And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
14426 swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him
14427 there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
14428 scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,
14429 fairest of her race.
14430 
14431 Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's
14432 snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in
14433 the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob
14434 Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the
14435 door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen
14436 in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and
14437 the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a
14438 poodle. I thought Alf would split.
14439 
14440 Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a
14441 postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...
14442 
14443 And he doubled up.
14444 
14445 Take a what? says I.
14446 
14447 Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.
14448 
14449 O hell! says I.
14450 
14451 The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you
14452 seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.
14453 
14454 Bi i dho husht,_ says he.
14455 
14456 Who? says Joe.
14457 
14458 Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round
14459 to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to
14460 the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The
14461 long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old
14462 lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.
14463 
14464 When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.
14465 
14466 Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?
14467 
14468 Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a
14469 pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen
14470 long John's eye. U. p...
14471 
14472 And he started laughing.
14473 
14474 Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?
14475 
14476 Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.
14477 
14478 Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup
14479 full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
14480 Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
14481 deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and
14482 mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour
14483 juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day
14484 from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.
14485 
14486 Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,
14487 that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that
14488 thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.
14489 
14490 But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone
14491 in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of
14492 costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen
14493 the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick,
14494 Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the
14495 United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions
14496 beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even
14497 she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for
14498 they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down
14499 thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.
14500 
14501 What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and
14502 down outside?
14503 
14504 What's that? says Joe.
14505 
14506 Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,
14507 I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.
14508 
14509 So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.
14510 
14511 Are you codding? says I.
14512 
14513 Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.
14514 
14515 So Joe took up the letters.
14516 
14517 Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.
14518 
14519 So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when
14520 the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:
14521 
14522 How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?
14523 
14524 I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
14525 Dignam. Only I was running after that...
14526 
14527 You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?
14528 
14529 With Dignam, says Alf.
14530 
14531 Is it Paddy? says Joe.
14532 
14533 Yes, says Alf. Why?
14534 
14535 Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.
14536 
14537 Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.
14538 
14539 Ay, says Joe.
14540 
14541 Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as
14542 a pikestaff.
14543 
14544 Who's dead? says Bob Doran.
14545 
14546 You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.
14547 
14548 What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray
14549 with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam
14550 dead?
14551 
14552 What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?
14553 
14554 Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.
14555 
14556 Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning
14557 anyhow.
14558 
14559 Paddy? says Alf.
14560 
14561 Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.
14562 
14563 Good Christ! says Alf.
14564 
14565 Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.
14566 
14567 In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
14568 tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
14569 luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of
14570 the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge
14571 of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was
14572 effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery
14573 and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.
14574 Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he
14575 stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still
14576 submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the
14577 lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations
14578 in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a
14579 glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities
14580 of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life
14581 there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard
14582 from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were
14583 equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar,
14584 hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in
14585 waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of
14586 buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he
14587 had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the
14588 wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported
14589 in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the
14590 eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there
14591 were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was:
14592 We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K.
14593 doesn't pile it on._ It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr
14594 Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular
14595 funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been
14596 responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before
14597 departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that
14598 the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the
14599 commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's
14600 to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had
14601 greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly
14602 requested that his desire should be made known.
14603 
14604 Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
14605 intimated that this had given satisfaction.
14606 
14607 He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was
14608 his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with
14609 your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.
14610 
14611 There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.
14612 
14613 Who? says I.
14614 
14615 Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten
14616 minutes.
14617 
14618 And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.
14619 
14620 Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.
14621 
14622 Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.
14623 
14624 And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest
14625 blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:
14626 
14627 Who said Christ is good?
14628 
14629 I beg your parsnips, says Alf.
14630 
14631 Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy
14632 Dignam?
14633 
14634 Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.
14635 
14636 But Bob Doran shouts out of him.
14637 
14638 He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.
14639 
14640 Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't
14641 want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran
14642 starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.
14643 
14644 The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.
14645 
14646 The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter
14647 for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the
14648 bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that
14649 used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was
14650 stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing
14651 her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.
14652 
14653 The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy,
14654 poor little Paddy Dignam.
14655 
14656 And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that
14657 beam of heaven.
14658 
14659 Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round
14660 the door.
14661 
14662 Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.
14663 
14664 So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was
14665 Martin Cunningham there.
14666 
14667 O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to
14668 this, will you?
14669 
14670 And he starts reading out one.
14671 
14672 7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin._
14673 
14674 Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful
14675 case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i
14676 hanged..._
14677 
14678 Show us, Joe, says I.
14679 
14680  private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in
14681 Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._
14682 
14683 Jesus, says I.
14684 
14685  Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._
14686 
14687 The citizen made a grab at the letter.
14688 
14689 Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once
14690 in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my
14691 terms is five ginnees._
14692 
14693 H. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER._
14694 
14695 And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.
14696 
14697 And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them
14698 to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?
14699 
14700 So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he
14701 couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well
14702 he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.
14703 
14704 Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.
14705 
14706 And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a
14707 black border round it.
14708 
14709 They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
14710 their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.
14711 
14712 And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his
14713 heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
14714 chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.
14715 
14716 In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their
14717 deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
14718 wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
14719 saith the Lord.
14720 
14721 So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
14722 comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
14723 business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies
14724 does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't
14725 know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.
14726 
14727 There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.
14728 
14729 What's that? says Joe.
14730 
14731 The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.
14732 
14733 That so? says Joe.
14734 
14735 God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in
14736 
14737 Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when
14738 they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like
14739 a poker.
14740 
14741 Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.
14742 
14743 That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural
14744 phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...
14745 
14746 And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and
14747 this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.
14748 
14749 The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
14750 medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
14751 cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
14752 according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
14753 calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
14754 ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
14755 thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
14756 dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
14757 to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
14758 resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty
14759 a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
14760 mortis per diminutionem capitis._
14761 
14762 So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
14763 he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and
14764 the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with
14765 him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for
14766 the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that
14767 and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new
14768 dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round
14769 the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that
14770 was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of
14771 course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
14772 
14773 Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw
14774 here! Give us the paw!
14775 
14776 Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from
14777 tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
14778 all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
14779 intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few
14780 bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to
14781 bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
14782 out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody
14783 mongrel.
14784 
14785 And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
14786 brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet
14787 and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
14788 she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown
14789 cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he
14790 married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.
14791 Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there
14792 was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom
14793 trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bizique
14794 to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a
14795 Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the
14796 lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,
14797 by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as
14798 drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of
14799 alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's
14800 a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the
14801 hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing
14802 the fat. And Bloom with his _but don't you see?_ and _but on the other
14803 hand_. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after,
14804 the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five
14805 times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the
14806 bloody establishment. Phenomenon!
14807 
14808 The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
14809 glaring at Bloom.
14810 
14811 Ay, ay, says Joe.
14812 
14813 You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...
14814 
14815 Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen. _Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love
14816 are by our side and the foes we hate before us.
14817 
14818 The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far
14819 and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
14820 gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
14821 punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening
14822 claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up
14823 the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
14824 supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain
14825 poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the
14826 bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the
14827 lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin
14828 Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
14829 maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
14830 reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
14831 their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
14832 the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains
14833 and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
14834 country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable
14835 amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
14836 M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual
14837 mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
14838 with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
14839 who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity
14840 will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and
14841 Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene
14842 were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment
14843 and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their
14844 excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children
14845 a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included
14846 many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most
14847 favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign
14848 delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated
14849 on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force,
14850 consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed
14851 doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a
14852 powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitipatant, the Grandjoker
14853 Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von
14854 Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Viraga Kisaszony Putrapesthi,
14855 Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh
14856 Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras
14857 y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung
14858 Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe
14859 Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus
14860 Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli,
14861 Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent
14862 generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the
14863 delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest
14864 possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which
14865 they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which
14866 all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth
14867 or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's
14868 patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,
14869 boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
14870 catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to
14871 and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable
14872 MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly
14873 restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth
14874 of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending
14875 parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all
14876 and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily
14877 congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding
14878 profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from
14879 underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
14880 adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
14881 thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
14882 pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
14883 senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and
14884 gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
14885 rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.
14886 
14887 Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
14888 morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus
14889 Cruentus_. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough
14890 which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate--short,
14891 painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the
14892 worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the
14893 huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in
14894 their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates
14895 cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,
14896 chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing
14897 evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling
14898 those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured
14899 our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly
14900 seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by
14901 megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's
14902 patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family
14903 since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser
14904 in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last
14905 comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death
14906 penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his
14907 cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace
14908 fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure
14909 of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot
14910 with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered
14911 furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his
14912 horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated
14913 in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the
14914 admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table
14915 near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various
14916 finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the
14917 worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield),
14918 a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon,
14919 blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two
14920 commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the
14921 most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and
14922 dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished
14923 to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of
14924 rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious
14925 hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided
14926 by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the
14927 tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced
14928 the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he,
14929 with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion
14930 and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal
14931 should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and
14932 indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem.
14933 The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing
14934 bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders
14935 and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be
14936 launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in
14937 a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_. Encouraged by
14938 this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various
14939 suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb
14940 permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt
14941 streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she
14942 would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his
14943 lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She
14944 brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood
14945 together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
14946 innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
14947 they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable
14948 pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply
14949 rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped
14950 their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their
14951 lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost
14952 core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the
14953 aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and
14954 genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of
14955 their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye
14956 in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a
14957 handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair
14958 sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook
14959 and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,
14960 requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady
14961 in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion
14962 in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous
14963 act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young
14964 Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names
14965 in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancie_ an
14966 expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a
14967 fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the
14968 ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan
14969 Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a
14970 considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching,
14971 could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet
14972 he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged
14973 burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to
14974 himself in a faltering undertone:
14975 
14976 God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it
14977 makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
14978 I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.
14979 
14980 So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
14981 corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak
14982 their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
14983 quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that
14984 he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
14985 antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is
14986 about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down
14987 his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth
14988 of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
14989 musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
14990 hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
14991 blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
14992 bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals
14993 and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
14994 entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And
14995 then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
14996 shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two
14997 sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
14998 females, hitting below the belt.
14999 
15000 So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
15001 starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I
15002 would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
15003 where it wouldn't blind him.
15004 
15005 Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.
15006 
15007 No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.
15008 
15009 So he calls the old dog over.
15010 
15011 What's on you, Garry? says he.
15012 
15013 Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
15014 old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.
15015 Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that
15016 has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to
15017 the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling
15018 and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the
15019 hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.
15020 
15021 All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
15022 lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
15023 missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
15024 famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of
15025 Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and
15026 acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years
15027 of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system,
15028 comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our
15029 greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!)
15030 has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare
15031 the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the
15032 italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not
15033 speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who
15034 conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little
15035 Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as
15036 a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication
15037 published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal
15038 note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and
15039 of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present
15040 very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been
15041 rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we
15042 are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will
15043 find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical
15044 system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative
15045 and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more
15046 complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has
15047 been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly
15048 increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in
15049 a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.
15050 
15051      _The curse of my curses
15052      Seven days every day
15053      And seven dry Thursdays
15054      On you, Barney Kiernan,
15055      Has no sup of water
15056      To cool my courage,
15057      And my guts red roaring
15058      After Lowry's lights._
15059 
15060 So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
15061 hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have
15062 another.
15063 
15064 I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there's no ill feeling.
15065 
15066 Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one
15067 pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog
15068 and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for
15069 man and beast. And says Joe:
15070 
15071 Could you make a hole in another pint?
15072 
15073 Could a swim duck? says I.
15074 
15075 Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in
15076 the way of liquid refreshment? says he.
15077 
15078 Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet
15079 Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's.
15080 Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't
15081 serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and
15082 nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.
15083 
15084 Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is
15085 landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?
15086 
15087 Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.
15088 
15089 Whose admirers? says Joe.
15090 
15091 The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.
15092 
15093 Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
15094 like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit
15095 of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
15096 Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow
15097 contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled
15098 with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in
15099 himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a
15100 friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal
15101 Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an
15102 israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.
15103 
15104 So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he
15105 was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and
15106 to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was
15107 never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her.
15108 Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic
15109 to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.
15110 
15111 Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
15112 slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,
15113 as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of
15114 you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve
15115 let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.
15116 
15117 No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
15118 actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to
15119 me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
15120 this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of
15121 the cup.
15122 
15123 Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart,
15124 I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words
15125 the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
15126 poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
15127 speech.
15128 
15129 And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
15130 o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the
15131 bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after
15132 closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking
15133 porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls,
15134 Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving
15135 mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote
15136 the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And
15137 the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody
15138 fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls
15139 screeching laughing at one another. _How is your testament? Have you got
15140 an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then
15141 see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging
15142 her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no
15143 less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's
15144 sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street
15145 couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up
15146 the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.
15147 
15148 So Terry brought the three pints.
15149 
15150 Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.
15151 
15152 Slan leat_, says he.
15153 
15154 Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.
15155 
15156 Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small
15157 fortune to keep him in drinks.
15158 
15159 Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.
15160 
15161 Friend of yours, says Alf.
15162 
15163 Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?
15164 
15165 I won't mention any names, says Alf.
15166 
15167 I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William
15168 Field, M. P., the cattle traders.
15169 
15170 Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of
15171 all countries and the idol of his own.
15172 
15173 So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease
15174 and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen
15175 sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his
15176 sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the
15177 guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a
15178 knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head
15179 and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot
15180 for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how
15181 to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used
15182 to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out
15183 with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting
15184 strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do
15185 it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor
15186 animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't
15187 cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,
15188 he'd have a soft hand under a hen.
15189 
15190 Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for
15191 us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then
15192 comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her
15193 fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.
15194 
15195 Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London
15196 to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.
15197 
15198 Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see
15199 him, as it happens.
15200 
15201 Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.
15202 
15203 That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr
15204 Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?
15205 
15206 Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question
15207 tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the
15208 park. What do you think of that, citizen? _The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.
15209 
15210 Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of
15211 my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
15212 honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these
15213 animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming
15214 as to their pathological condition?
15215 
15216 Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in
15217 possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole
15218 house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the
15219 honourable member's question is in the affirmative.
15220 
15221 Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
15222 for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
15223 Phoenix park?
15224 
15225 Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.
15226 
15227 Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous
15228 Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury
15229 bench? (O! O!)
15230 
15231 Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.
15232 
15233 Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.
15234 
15235 Ironical opposition cheers.)
15236 
15237 The speaker: Order! Order!
15238 
15239 The house rises. Cheers.)
15240 
15241 There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There
15242 he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion
15243 of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best
15244 throw, citizen?
15245 
15246 Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a
15247 time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.
15248 
15249 Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.
15250 
15251 Is that really a fact? says Alf.
15252 
15253 Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?
15254 
15255 So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
15256 lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil
15257 and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom
15258 had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent
15259 exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw
15260 from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom. Do you
15261 see that straw? That's a straw_. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it
15262 for an hour so he would and talk steady.
15263 
15264 A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian
15265 O'ciarnain's_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of
15266 Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
15267 importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
15268 ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.
15269 The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
15270 attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by
15271 the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,
15272 a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard
15273 of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of
15274 the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The
15275 wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr
15276 Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of
15277 the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening
15278 by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly
15279 strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who
15280 met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the
15281 negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in
15282 response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of
15283 a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal
15284 Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need
15285 recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the
15286 veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction
15287 to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in
15288 superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest
15289 advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing
15290 it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly
15291 enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously
15292 applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many
15293 prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press
15294 and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then
15295 terminated.
15296 
15297 Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L.
15298 L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S.
15299 Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev.
15300 P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr.
15301 Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T.
15302 Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery,
15303 V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O.
15304 M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the
15305 rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr
15306 M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M.
15307 D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy
15308 canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P.
15309 Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.
15310 
15311 Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that
15312 Keogh-Bennett match?
15313 
15314 No, says Joe.
15315 
15316 I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.
15317 
15318 Who? Blazes? says Joe.
15319 
15320 And says Bloom:
15321 
15322 What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training
15323 the eye.
15324 
15325 Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
15326 the odds and he swatting all the time.
15327 
15328 We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put
15329 English gold in his pocket.
15330 
15331 True for you, says Joe.
15332 
15333 And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
15334 blood, asking Alf:
15335 
15336 Now, don't you think, Bergan?
15337 
15338 Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only
15339 a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See
15340 the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,
15341 he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made
15342 him puke what he never ate.
15343 
15344 It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled
15345 to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he
15346 was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative
15347 skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both
15348 champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret
15349 in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of
15350 rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the
15351 pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to
15352 business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish
15353 gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of
15354 Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a
15355 left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips.
15356 Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with
15357 the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose
15358 right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally
15359 drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of
15360 pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was
15361 a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers
15362 and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy
15363 for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.
15364 After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of
15365 the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the
15366 lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to
15367 Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean
15368 and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being
15369 counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the
15370 towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of
15371 the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with
15372 delight.
15373 
15374 He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's
15375 running a concert tour now up in the north.
15376 
15377 He is, says Joe. Isn't he?
15378 
15379 Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer
15380 tour, you see. Just a holiday.
15381 
15382 Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.
15383 
15384 My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success
15385 too.
15386 
15387 He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.
15388 
15389 Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the
15390 cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the
15391 tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island
15392 bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight
15393 the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr
15394 Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the
15395 bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.
15396 
15397 Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There
15398 grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The
15399 gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.
15400 The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.
15401 
15402 And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero
15403 of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned
15404 in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of
15405 Lambert.
15406 
15407 Hello, Ned.
15408 
15409 Hello, Alf.
15410 
15411 Hello, Jack.
15412 
15413 Hello, Joe.
15414 
15415 God save you, says the citizen.
15416 
15417 Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?
15418 
15419 Half one, says Ned.
15420 
15421 So J. J. ordered the drinks.
15422 
15423 Were you round at the court? says Joe.
15424 
15425 Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.
15426 
15427 Hope so, says Ned.
15428 
15429 Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list
15430 and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's.
15431 Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their
15432 eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.
15433 Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would
15434 know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing
15435 his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and
15436 done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days,
15437 I'm thinking.
15438 
15439 Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.
15440 
15441 Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.
15442 
15443 Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only
15444 Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined
15445 first.
15446 
15447 Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to
15448 hear him before a judge and jury.
15449 
15450 Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and
15451 nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.
15452 
15453 Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.
15454 
15455 Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence
15456 against you.
15457 
15458 Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not
15459 compos mentis_. U. p: up.
15460 
15461 Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy?
15462 Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat
15463 on with a shoehorn.
15464 
15465 Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an
15466 indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.
15467 
15468 Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.
15469 
15470 Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.
15471 
15472 Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half
15473 and half.
15474 
15475 How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...
15476 
15477 Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish
15478 nor flesh.
15479 
15480 Nor good red herring, says Joe.
15481 
15482 That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what
15483 that is.
15484 
15485 Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on
15486 account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the
15487 old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody
15488 povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,
15489 bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she
15490 married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the
15491 pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches,
15492 the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the
15493 Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was
15494 he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a
15495 week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to
15496 the world.
15497 
15498 And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to
15499 be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my
15500 opinion an action might lie.
15501 
15502 Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our
15503 pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.
15504 
15505 Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.
15506 
15507 Good health, Ned, says J. J.
15508 
15509 There he is again, says Joe.
15510 
15511 Where? says Alf.
15512 
15513 And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter
15514 and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in
15515 as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
15516 secondhand coffin.
15517 
15518 How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.
15519 
15520 Remanded, says J. J.
15521 
15522 One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
15523 Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers
15524 saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see
15525 any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What?
15526 Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and
15527 his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew
15528 Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,
15529 swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.
15530 
15531 Who tried the case? says Joe.
15532 
15533 Recorder, says Ned.
15534 
15535 Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.
15536 
15537 Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
15538 of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve
15539 in tears on the bench.
15540 
15541 Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock
15542 the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for
15543 the corporation there near Butt bridge.
15544 
15545 And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
15546 
15547 A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?
15548 Ten, did you say?
15549 
15550 Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.
15551 
15552 And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court
15553 immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you,
15554 sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking
15555 industrious man! I dismiss the case.
15556 
15557 And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and
15558 in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
15559 the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first
15560 quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the
15561 halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave
15562 his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the
15563 probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first
15564 chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and
15565 final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of
15566 the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone,
15567 an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of
15568 Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there
15569 about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at
15570 the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the
15571 county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim
15572 of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of
15573 Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the
15574 tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and
15575 of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of
15576 Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the
15577 tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he
15578 conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and
15579 truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their
15580 sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict
15581 give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And
15582 they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by
15583 the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His
15584 rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
15585 their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended
15586 in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and
15587 foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge
15588 against him for he was a malefactor.
15589 
15590 Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
15591 filling the country with bugs.
15592 
15593 So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,
15594 telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first
15595 but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high
15596 and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.
15597 
15598 Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
15599 repetition. That's the whole secret.
15600 
15601 Rely on me, says Joe.
15602 
15603 Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We
15604 want no more strangers in our house.
15605 
15606 O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that
15607 Keyes, you see.
15608 
15609 Consider that done, says Joe.
15610 
15611 Very kind of you, says Bloom.
15612 
15613 The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.
15614 We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
15615 robbers here.
15616 
15617 Decree _nisi,_ says J. J.
15618 
15619 And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
15620 spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
15621 after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and
15622 when.
15623 
15624 A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all
15625 our misfortunes.
15626 
15627 And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_
15628 with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.
15629 
15630 Give us a squint at her, says I.
15631 
15632 And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off
15633 of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct
15634 of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds
15635 pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her
15636 bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles
15637 and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be
15638 late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.
15639 
15640 O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
15641 
15642 There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off
15643 of that one, what?
15644 
15645 So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on
15646 him as long as a late breakfast.
15647 
15648 Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action?
15649 What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide
15650 about the Irish language?
15651 
15652 O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
15653 puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of
15654 that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient
15655 city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after
15656 due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn
15657 counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into
15658 honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.
15659 
15660 It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal
15661 Sassenachs and their _patois._
15662 
15663 So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till
15664 you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your
15665 blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach
15666 a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and
15667 their colonies and their civilisation.
15668 
15669 Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with
15670 them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody
15671 thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature
15672 worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us.
15673 Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.
15674 
15675 The European family, says J. J....
15676 
15677 They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin
15678 Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language
15679 anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d'aisance._
15680 
15681 And says John Wyse:
15682 
15683 Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.
15684 
15685 And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
15686 
15687 Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_
15688 
15689 He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the
15690 medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh
15691 Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
15692 valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster
15693 silent as the deathless gods.
15694 
15695 What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had
15696 lost a bob and found a tanner.
15697 
15698 Gold cup, says he.
15699 
15700 Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.
15701 
15702 Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest
15703 nowhere.
15704 
15705 And Bass's mare? says Terry.
15706 
15707 Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid
15708 on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.
15709 
15710 I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn
15711 gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.
15712 
15713 Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. _Throwaway,_
15714 says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name
15715 is _Sceptre._
15716 
15717 So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
15718 anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
15719 luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.
15720 
15721 Not there, my child, says he.
15722 
15723 Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the
15724 other dog.
15725 
15726 And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
15727 sticking in an odd word.
15728 
15729 Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they
15730 can't see the beam in their own.
15731 
15732 Raimeis_, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow
15733 that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing
15734 twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost
15735 tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!
15736 And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax
15737 and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our
15738 tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our
15739 Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk
15740 and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent
15741 in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the
15742 Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar
15743 now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to
15744 sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even
15745 Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from
15746 Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish
15747 hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for
15748 the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe
15749 us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the
15750 Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and
15751 bog to make us all die of consumption?
15752 
15753 As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland
15754 with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.
15755 Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was
15756 reading a report of lord Castletown's...
15757 
15758 Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain
15759 elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the
15760 trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of
15761 Eire, O.
15762 
15763 Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.
15764 
15765 The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon
15766 at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief
15767 ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine
15768 Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,
15769 Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde
15770 Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia
15771 Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs
15772 Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss
15773 Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel
15774 Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,
15775 Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana
15776 Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis
15777 graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by
15778 her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in
15779 a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip
15780 of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with
15781 a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by
15782 bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss
15783 Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very
15784 becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being
15785 worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the
15786 jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.
15787 Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability
15788 and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played
15789 a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the
15790 conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in
15791 Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a
15792 playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow,
15793 ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs
15794 Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.
15795 
15796 And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with
15797 Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
15798 pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.
15799 
15800 And will again, says Joe.
15801 
15802 And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
15803 citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full
15804 again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom
15805 of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with
15806 a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the
15807 O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
15808 the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the
15809 first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to
15810 the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat,
15811 the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue
15812 field, the three sons of Milesius.
15813 
15814 And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like
15815 a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody
15816 life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled
15817 multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly
15818 Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
15819 holding of an evicted tenant.
15820 
15821 Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?
15822 
15823 An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.
15824 
15825 Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you
15826 asleep?
15827 
15828 Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.
15829 
15830 Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of
15831 attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to
15832 crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head
15833 down like a bull at a gate. And another one: _Black Beast Burned in
15834 Omaha, Ga_. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a
15835 Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under
15836 him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and
15837 crucify him to make sure of their job.
15838 
15839 But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at
15840 bay?
15841 
15842 I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.
15843 Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on
15844 the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself
15845 Disgusted One_.
15846 
15847 So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew
15848 of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
15849 parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
15850 brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of
15851 a gun.
15852 
15853 A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
15854 Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on
15855 the breech.
15856 
15857 And says John Wyse:
15858 
15859 'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
15860 
15861 Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane
15862 and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
15863 till he yells meila murder.
15864 
15865 That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
15866 earth.
15867 
15868 The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber
15869 on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen
15870 gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about
15871 of drudges and whipped serfs.
15872 
15873 On which the sun never rises, says Joe.
15874 
15875 And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The
15876 unfortunate yahoos believe it.
15877 
15878 They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
15879 and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
15880 born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,
15881 flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose
15882 again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till
15883 further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.
15884 
15885 But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't
15886 it be the same here if you put force against force?
15887 
15888 Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his
15889 last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.
15890 
15891 We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater
15892 Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the
15893 black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
15894 low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the
15895 whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
15896 redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the
15897 Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full
15898 of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,
15899 they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in
15900 the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember
15901 the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
15902 cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.
15903 
15904 Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...
15905 
15906 We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the
15907 poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
15908 Killala.
15909 
15910 Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
15911 against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the
15912 broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the
15913 wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan
15914 in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria
15915 Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?
15916 
15917 The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know
15918 what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they
15919 trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with
15920 perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.
15921 
15922 Conspuez les Frangais_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.
15923 
15924 And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we
15925 had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the
15926 elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?
15927 
15928 Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one
15929 with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of
15930 God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting
15931 her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the
15932 whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_
15933 and come where the boose is cheaper.
15934 
15935 Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.
15936 
15937 Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox
15938 than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!
15939 
15940 And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests
15941 and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic
15942 Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his
15943 jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.
15944 
15945 They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
15946 Alf.
15947 
15948 And says J. J.:
15949 
15950 Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.
15951 
15952 Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.
15953 
15954 Yes, sir, says he. I will.
15955 
15956 You? says Joe.
15957 
15958 Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.
15959 
15960 Repeat that dose, says Joe.
15961 
15962 Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
15963 his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.
15964 
15965 Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.
15966 Perpetuating national hatred among nations.
15967 
15968 But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.
15969 
15970 Yes, says Bloom.
15971 
15972 What is it? says John Wyse.
15973 
15974 A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same
15975 place.
15976 
15977 By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm
15978 living in the same place for the past five years.
15979 
15980 So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck
15981 out of it:
15982 
15983 Or also living in different places.
15984 
15985 That covers my case, says Joe.
15986 
15987 What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.
15988 
15989 Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.
15990 
15991 The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
15992 gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.
15993 
15994 After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
15995 swab himself dry.
15996 
15997 Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and
15998 repeat after me the following words.
15999 
16000 The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth
16001 attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors
16002 of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth
16003 prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the
16004 cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each
16005 of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters
16006 his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far
16007 nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing),
16008 a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted
16009 on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs
16010 and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as
16011 wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo
16012 illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in
16013 the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney,
16014 the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins,
16015 Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery
16016 of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's
16017 banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick
16018 Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the
16019 Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail,
16020 Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice,
16021 Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college
16022 refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of
16023 Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street
16024 Warehouse, Fingal's Cave--all these moving scenes are still there for us
16025 today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have
16026 passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.
16027 
16028 Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?
16029 
16030 That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.
16031 
16032 And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.
16033 Also now. This very moment. This very instant.
16034 
16035 Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.
16036 
16037 Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs
16038 to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold
16039 by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.
16040 
16041 Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.
16042 
16043 I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.
16044 
16045 Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.
16046 
16047 That's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old
16048 lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a
16049 sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And
16050 then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as
16051 limp as a wet rag.
16052 
16053 But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not
16054 life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's
16055 the very opposite of that that is really life.
16056 
16057 What? says Alf.
16058 
16059 Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says
16060 he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
16061 there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.
16062 
16063 Who's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.
16064 
16065 A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.
16066 
16067 Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.
16068 
16069 That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,
16070 moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.
16071 
16072 Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A
16073 loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M.
16074 B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo,
16075 the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear
16076 trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the
16077 brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her
16078 Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love
16079 a certain person. And this person loves that other person because
16080 everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.
16081 
16082 Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power,
16083 citizen.
16084 
16085 Hurrah, there, says Joe.
16086 
16087 The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.
16088 
16089 And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.
16090 
16091 We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.
16092 What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women
16093 and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_
16094 pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit
16095 in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that's visiting
16096 England?
16097 
16098 What's that? says Joe.
16099 
16100 So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
16101 reading out:
16102 
16103 A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented
16104 yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting,
16105 Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt
16106 thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his
16107 dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which
16108 the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated
16109 by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones,
16110 tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial
16111 relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that
16112 he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible,
16113 the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness,
16114 graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw
16115 Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal
16116 Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the
16117 toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in
16118 the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited
16119 the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors'
16120 book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the
16121 course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious
16122 applause from the girl hands.
16123 
16124 Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that
16125 bible to the same use as I would.
16126 
16127 Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land
16128 the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.
16129 
16130 Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.
16131 
16132 No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only
16133 initialled: P.
16134 
16135 And a very good initial too, says Joe.
16136 
16137 That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.
16138 
16139 Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the
16140 Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man
16141 what's this his name is?
16142 
16143 Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.
16144 
16145 Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and
16146 flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can
16147 out of them.
16148 
16149 I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.
16150 
16151 Who? says I.
16152 
16153 Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on
16154 Throwaway_ and he's gone to gather in the shekels.
16155 
16156 Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a
16157 horse in anger in his life?
16158 
16159 That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back
16160 that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.
16161 Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the
16162 only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.
16163 
16164 He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.
16165 
16166 Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.
16167 
16168 There you are, says Terry.
16169 
16170 Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of
16171 the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was
16172 letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I
16173 to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in
16174 Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings
16175 is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was
16176 telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have
16177 done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she's
16178 better_ or _she's_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if
16179 he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland
16180 my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's
16181 the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.
16182 
16183 So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it
16184 was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper
16185 all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off
16186 of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
16187 about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that
16188 puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.
16189 Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody
16190 mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before
16191 him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that
16192 poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country
16193 with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.
16194 Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No
16195 security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the
16196 road with every one.
16197 
16198 Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll
16199 tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.
16200 
16201 Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power
16202 with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of
16203 the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the
16204 registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the
16205 country at the king's expense.
16206 
16207 Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
16208 palfreys.
16209 
16210 Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.
16211 Saucy knave! To us!
16212 
16213 So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.
16214 
16215 Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.
16216 
16217 Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.
16218 
16219 Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.
16220 And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.
16221 
16222 Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
16223 larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.
16224 
16225 How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
16226 countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?
16227 
16228 An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.
16229 
16230 Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's
16231 messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The
16232 king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my
16233 house I warrant me.
16234 
16235 Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty
16236 trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?
16237 
16238 Mine host bowed again as he made answer:
16239 
16240 What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
16241 venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head
16242 with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon
16243 of old Rhenish?
16244 
16245 Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!
16246 
16247 Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare
16248 larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.
16249 
16250 So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.
16251 
16252 Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.
16253 
16254 Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen
16255 about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?
16256 
16257 That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.
16258 
16259 Who made those allegations? says Alf.
16260 
16261 I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.
16262 
16263 And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like
16264 the next fellow?
16265 
16266 Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.
16267 
16268 Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the
16269 hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.
16270 
16271 Who is Junius? says J. J.
16272 
16273 We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.
16274 
16275 He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was
16276 he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that
16277 in the castle.
16278 
16279 Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.
16280 
16281 Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the
16282 father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the
16283 father did.
16284 
16285 That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints
16286 and sages!
16287 
16288 Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that
16289 matter so are we.
16290 
16291 Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their
16292 Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till
16293 he knows if he's a father or a mother.
16294 
16295 Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.
16296 
16297 O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
16298 that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a
16299 tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.
16300 
16301 En ventre sa mhre_, says J. J.
16302 
16303 Do you call that a man? says the citizen.
16304 
16305 I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.
16306 
16307 Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.
16308 
16309 And who does he suspect? says the citizen.
16310 
16311 Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed
16312 middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a
16313 month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm
16314 telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like
16315 of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it
16316 would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of
16317 stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your
16318 eye.
16319 
16320 Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.
16321 
16322 A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag
16323 from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.
16324 
16325 Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.
16326 
16327 Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.
16328 
16329 You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.
16330 
16331 Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
16332 says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our
16333 shores.
16334 
16335 Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my
16336 prayer.
16337 
16338 Amen, says the citizen.
16339 
16340 And I'm sure He will, says Joe.
16341 
16342 And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with
16343 acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and
16344 subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors
16345 and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,
16346 Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians
16347 and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,
16348 Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter
16349 Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet
16350 led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and
16351 friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,
16352 minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of
16353 Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks
16354 of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the
16355 christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And
16356 after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and
16357 S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S.
16358 Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and
16359 S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde
16360 and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and
16361 S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and
16362 S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence
16363 and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous
16364 and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S.
16365 Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and
16366 Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S.
16367 Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S.
16368 Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S.
16369 Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany
16370 and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth
16371 S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans
16372 and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S.
16373 Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr
16374 and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother
16375 Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S.
16376 Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and
16377 S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and
16378 the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S.
16379 Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came
16380 with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords
16381 and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of
16382 their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,
16383 trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,
16384 dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,
16385 soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches,
16386 forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a
16387 dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by
16388 Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain
16389 street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth
16390 Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_
16391 which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting
16392 out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the
16393 halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid,
16394 interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.
16395 And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father
16396 O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers
16397 had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co,
16398 limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine
16399 and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for
16400 consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed
16401 the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and
16402 the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches
16403 and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with
16404 blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had
16405 blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of
16406 His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the
16407 beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.
16408 
16409 Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._
16410 
16411 Qui fecit coelum et terram._
16412 
16413 Dominus vobiscum._
16414 
16415 Et cum spiritu tuo._
16416 
16417 And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed
16418 and they all with him prayed:
16419 
16420 Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde
16421 super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et
16422 voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem
16423 sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore
16424 percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._
16425 
16426 And so say all of us, says Jack.
16427 
16428 Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.
16429 
16430 Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.
16431 
16432 I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when
16433 be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.
16434 
16435 I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope
16436 I'm not...
16437 
16438 No, says Martin, we're ready.
16439 
16440 Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.
16441 Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's
16442 a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to
16443 five.
16444 
16445 Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,
16446 
16447 Beg your pardon, says he.
16448 
16449 Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.
16450 
16451 Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a
16452 secret.
16453 
16454 And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.
16455 
16456 Bye bye all, says Martin.
16457 
16458 And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or
16459 whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all
16460 at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.
16461 
16462 Off with you, says
16463 
16464 Martin to the jarvey.
16465 
16466 The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the
16467 helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward
16468 with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew
16469 nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of
16470 the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning
16471 wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the
16472 equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them
16473 all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they
16474 ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did
16475 they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And
16476 they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the
16477 waves.
16478 
16479 But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the
16480 citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the
16481 dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and
16482 candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf
16483 round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.
16484 
16485 Let me alone, says he.
16486 
16487 And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls
16488 out of him:
16489 
16490 Three cheers for Israel!
16491 
16492 Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake
16493 and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's
16494 always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about
16495 bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it
16496 would.
16497 
16498 And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and
16499 Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf
16500 and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and
16501 the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit
16502 down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over
16503 his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and
16504 a slut shouts out of her:
16505 
16506 Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
16507 
16508 And says he:
16509 
16510 Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And
16511 the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.
16512 
16513 He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.
16514 
16515 Whose God? says the citizen.
16516 
16517 Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a
16518 jew like me.
16519 
16520 Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.
16521 
16522 By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
16523 name.
16524 
16525 By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.
16526 
16527 Stop! Stop! says Joe.
16528 
16529 A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
16530 the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
16531 farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander
16532 Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure
16533 for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of
16534 Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great _iclat_ was
16535 characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll
16536 of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
16537 the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
16538 community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully
16539 executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects
16540 every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob. The departing
16541 guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were
16542 present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes
16543 struck up the wellknown strains of _Come back to Erin_, followed
16544 immediately by _Rakoczsy's March_. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted
16545 along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of
16546 Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of
16547 Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles
16548 and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve
16549 Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the
16550 welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of
16551 henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic
16552 pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from
16553 the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers
16554 while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges,
16555 the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute
16556 as were also those of the electrical power station at the
16557 Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. _Visszontlatasra, kedves baraton!
16558 Visszontlatasra!_ Gone but not forgotten.
16559 
16560 Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin
16561 anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he
16562 shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's
16563 royal theatre:
16564 
16565 Where is he till I murder him?
16566 
16567 And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.
16568 
16569 Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.
16570 
16571 But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other
16572 way and off with him.
16573 
16574 Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!
16575 
16576 Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the
16577 sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it
16578 into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old
16579 mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and
16580 laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.
16581 
16582 The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
16583 observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth
16584 grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar
16585 seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year
16586 of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been
16587 that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and
16588 parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods
16589 and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity
16590 of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself,
16591 in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in
16592 progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be
16593 feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of
16594 eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by
16595 a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of
16596 headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the
16597 crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle
16598 with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of
16599 the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick
16600 Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties
16601 in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third
16602 basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the
16603 extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near
16604 the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed
16605 an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the
16606 atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest
16607 by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received
16608 from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has
16609 been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_
16610 shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every
16611 cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual
16612 authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful
16613 departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.
16614 The work of salvage, removal of _dibris,_ human remains etc has been
16615 entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street,
16616 and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by
16617 the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the
16618 general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir
16619 Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K.
16620 C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B.

16623 
16624 You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that
16625 lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he
16626 would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and
16627 battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by
16628 furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And
16629 he let a volley of oaths after him.
16630 
16631 Did I kill him, says he, or what?
16632 
16633 And he shouting to the bloody dog:
16634 
16635 After him, Garry! After him, boy!
16636 
16637 And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
16638 sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his
16639 lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.
16640 Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise
16641 you.
16642 
16643 When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld
16644 the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in
16645 the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment
16646 as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not
16647 look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah!
16648 Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And they
16649 beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend
16650 to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over
16651 Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.
16652 
16653 
16654 
16655 The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
16656 embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
16657 all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
16658 promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
16659 the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on
16660 the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness
16661 the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to
16662 the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.
16663 
16664 The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
16665 scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and
16666 oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
16667 chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy
16668 Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and
16669 Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with
16670 caps to match and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy
16671 and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and
16672 spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with
16673 bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in
16674 the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do,
16675 or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And
16676 Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while
16677 that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven
16678 months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just
16679 beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to
16680 him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.
16681 
16682 Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of
16683 water.
16684 
16685 And baby prattled after her:
16686 
16687 A jink a jink a jawbo.
16688 
16689 Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,
16690 so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to
16691 take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and
16692 promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden
16693 syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby
16694 Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy
16695 bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy
16696 Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with
16697 a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe
16698 red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at
16699 the quaint language of little brother.
16700 
16701 But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and
16702 Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception
16703 to this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
16704 which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go
16705 wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the
16706 Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was
16707 selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house
16708 is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the
16709 wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle
16710 too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the
16711 attention of the girl friends.
16712 
16713 Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,
16714 Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I
16715 catch you for that.
16716 
16717 His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their
16718 big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was
16719 too after his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables
16720 were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing
16721 over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to
16722 be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening
16723 with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and
16724 shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him
16725 she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.
16726 
16727 Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.
16728 
16729 She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:
16730 
16731 What's your name? Butter and cream?
16732 
16733 Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your
16734 sweetheart?
16735 
16736 Nao, tearful Tommy said.
16737 
16738 Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.
16739 
16740 Nao, Tommy said.
16741 
16742 I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from
16743 her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. Gerty is
16744 Tommy's sweetheart.
16745 
16746 Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.
16747 
16748 Cissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to
16749 Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
16750 couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.
16751 
16752 But who was Gerty?
16753 
16754 Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
16755 gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen
16756 of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced
16757 beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was
16758 more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful,
16759 inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking
16760 of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's
16761 female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to
16762 get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost
16763 spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine
16764 Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster
16765 with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments
16766 could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves
16767 in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to
16768 Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn
16769 with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to
16770 time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever
16771 she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her
16772 again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement,
16773 a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced
16774 in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed
16775 her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had
16776 she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might
16777 easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen
16778 herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors
16779 at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.
16780 Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her
16781 softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,
16782 that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm
16783 few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of
16784 the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive
16785 brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It
16786 was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the
16787 Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which
16788 gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders
16789 of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing
16790 scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you
16791 have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because
16792 she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of
16793 wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut
16794 it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about
16795 her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails
16796 too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale
16797 flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she
16798 looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's
16799 fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.
16800 
16801 For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She
16802 was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.
16803 Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.
16804 The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into
16805 a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May
16806 morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy
16807 say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
16808 lovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the
16809 boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up
16810 and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the
16811 evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was
16812 on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when
16813 he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing
16814 in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he
16815 perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,
16816 piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn
16817 to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course
16818 Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then
16819 Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and
16820 he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too
16821 at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something
16822 off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his
16823 hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes
16824 and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy
16825 Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and
16826 ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.
16827 
16828 Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
16829 Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be
16830 out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it
16831 was expected in the _Lady's Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn)
16832 with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in
16833 which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
16834 favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
16835 threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure
16836 to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved
16837 nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and
16838 at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon
16839 she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she
16840 wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you
16841 would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by
16842 herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the
16843 lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put
16844 it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the
16845 shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in
16846 footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she
16847 never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash,
16848 oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over
16849 her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect
16850 proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of
16851 her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
16852 wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who
16853 that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though
16854 Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to
16855 blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery,
16856 three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different
16857 coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired
16858 them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed
16859 them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't
16860 trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things.
16861 She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour
16862 and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because
16863 the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father
16864 brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because
16865 she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that
16866 morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that
16867 was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things on inside
16868 out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it
16869 wasn't of a Friday.
16870 
16871 And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is
16872 there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
16873 worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where,
16874 giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup
16875 feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before
16876 the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening
16877 falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns
16878 in vain. Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a
16879 marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy
16880 Wylie T. C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be
16881 Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was
16882 wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox
16883 was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in
16884 love, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer's
16885 he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole
16886 an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her
16887 little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the
16888 first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from
16889 the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of
16890 character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would
16891 woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always
16892 waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No
16893 prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her
16894 feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found
16895 his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would
16896 understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all
16897 the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long
16898 long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy
16899 summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his
16900 affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death
16901 us two part, from this to this day forward.
16902 
16903 And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
16904 just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
16905 little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in
16906 the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would
16907 be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts
16908 too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that
16909 feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and
16910 queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions
16911 from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge
16912 in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction,
16913 then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though
16914 she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her
16915 shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like
16916 violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom
16917 with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's
16918 lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz
16919 covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer
16920 jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with
16921 broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with
16922 glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache
16923 and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful
16924 weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little
16925 homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but
16926 perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to
16927 business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze
16928 for a moment deep down into her eyes.
16929 
16930 Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
16931 buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off
16932 and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said
16933 he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the
16934 ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it
16935 was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
16936 you please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy
16937 Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off
16938 now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.
16939 
16940 You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.
16941 
16942 But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
16943 finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and
16944 Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.
16945 
16946 Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.
16947 
16948 And she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played
16949 here's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread
16950 carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper
16951 chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
16952 like that from everyone always petting him.
16953 
16954 I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't
16955 say.
16956 
16957 On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.
16958 
16959 Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
16960 saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her
16961 life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was
16962 sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared
16963 Ciss.
16964 
16965 Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
16966 her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at
16967 him.
16968 
16969 Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.
16970 For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and
16971 jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her
16972 nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go
16973 where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss
16974 White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the
16975 evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork
16976 moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There
16977 was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of
16978 the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced
16979 things, too sweet to be wholesome.
16980 
16981 And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
16982 anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat conducted
16983 by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and
16984 benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered
16985 together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying
16986 spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the
16987 storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate,
16988 reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede
16989 for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How
16990 sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of
16991 the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit
16992 cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage,
16993 second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by
16994 the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two
16995 lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at
16996 the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction
16997 which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her
16998 childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of
16999 violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to
17000 the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was
17001 one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts
17002 his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded
17003 as the lowest of the low.
17004 
17005 And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
17006 Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard
17007 her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman
17008 off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like
17009 himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him
17010 any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
17011 father because he was too old or something or on account of his face
17012 it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the
17013 pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor
17014 father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,
17015 Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they
17016 had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for
17017 supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that
17018 died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her
17019 mother's birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom
17020 and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have
17021 had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he
17022 was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to
17023 him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on
17024 account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the
17025 letters and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic,
17026 standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright
17027 and cheery in the home.
17028 
17029 A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
17030 house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in
17031 gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was
17032 it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't
17033 like her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single
17034 thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the
17035 world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at
17036 the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that
17037 place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr
17038 Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days
17039 where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a
17040 threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
17041 oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a
17042 story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in
17043 a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in
17044 chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them
17045 dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
17046 arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back
17047 and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker's
17048 pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the
17049 halcyon days what they meant.
17050 
17051 The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion
17052 till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was
17053 no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
17054 could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was
17055 not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
17056 sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
17057 the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and
17058 to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to
17059 her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw
17060 it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and
17061 stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock. The
17062 twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and
17063 let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their
17064 stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she
17065 missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.
17066 
17067 If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.
17068 
17069 Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her
17070 pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
17071 her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a
17072 jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down
17073 towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw
17074 attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the
17075 warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and
17076 flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of
17077 the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a
17078 look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan
17079 and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.
17080 
17081 Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
17082 and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of
17083 original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
17084 for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And
17085 careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many
17086 who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all
17087 that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told
17088 them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the
17089 most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in any
17090 age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned
17091 by her.
17092 
17093 The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
17094 childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with
17095 baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep
17096 she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy
17097 gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,
17098 didn't the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.
17099 
17100 Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.
17101 
17102 And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
17103 eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
17104 health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out
17105 to be something great, they said.
17106 
17107 Haja ja ja haja.
17108 
17109 Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to
17110 sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried
17111 out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half
17112 blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most
17113 obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:
17114 
17115 Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.
17116 
17117 And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all
17118 no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
17119 geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave
17120 him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was
17121 quickly appeased.
17122 
17123 Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
17124 of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
17125 brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the
17126 paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured
17127 chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the
17128 evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to
17129 hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned
17130 in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went
17131 pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his
17132 look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through
17133 and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly
17134 expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could
17135 see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he
17136 was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the
17137 matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she
17138 wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always
17139 dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had
17140 an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussi_ from where he was sitting.
17141 He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting
17142 sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what
17143 it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the
17144 ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if
17145 she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad
17146 that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking
17147 Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which
17148 she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on
17149 her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he
17150 was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him,
17151 her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had
17152 suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had
17153 been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a
17154 protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved
17155 her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a
17156 womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known,
17157 those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to
17158 know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,
17159 make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her
17160 gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her,
17161 his ownest girlie, for herself alone.
17162 
17163 Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. _Ora pro nobis_. Well
17164 has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy
17165 can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge
17166 for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced
17167 her own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the
17168 stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue
17169 banners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping
17170 Canon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes
17171 cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet
17172 and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever
17173 she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to
17174 the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when
17175 she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her
17176 hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the
17177 voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, he said, in
17178 this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of
17179 woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said
17180 to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He
17181 was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could
17182 she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a
17183 present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece
17184 white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell
17185 the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours'
17186 adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or
17187 perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.
17188 
17189 The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
17190 threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little
17191 monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them
17192 a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
17193 them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
17194 were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.
17195 
17196 Jacky! Tommy!
17197 
17198 Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very
17199 last time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and
17200 she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had
17201 a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the
17202 thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow
17203 long because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at
17204 it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up
17205 her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot
17206 of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever
17207 she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was
17208 a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her
17209 petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It
17210 would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something
17211 accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to
17212 make her look tall and got a fine tumble. _Tableau!_ That would have
17213 been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.
17214 
17215 Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
17216 they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed
17217 the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the
17218 Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was
17219 itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't
17220 because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger
17221 mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that
17222 he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the
17223 thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed
17224 Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just
17225 swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to
17226 the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_. Three and eleven she paid for those
17227 stockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday
17228 before Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he
17229 was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had
17230 neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his
17231 head to see the difference for himself.
17232 
17233 Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
17234 her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a
17235 streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only
17236 a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat
17237 hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to
17238 settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was
17239 never seen on a girl's shoulders--a radiant little vision, in sooth,
17240 almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long
17241 mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost
17242 see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her
17243 tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from
17244 underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath
17245 caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a
17246 snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised
17247 the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat
17248 to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.
17249 
17250 Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
17251 half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
17252 baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why
17253 no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of
17254 hers. And she said to Gerty:
17255 
17256 A penny for your thoughts.
17257 
17258 What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I
17259 was only wondering was it late.
17260 
17261 Because she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and
17262 their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
17263 gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy
17264 asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half
17265 past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because
17266 they were told to be in early.
17267 
17268 Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the
17269 time by his conundrum.
17270 
17271 So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
17272 hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
17273 watchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was
17274 Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he
17275 had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the
17276 next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed
17277 in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.
17278 
17279 Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
17280 right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it
17281 and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his
17282 watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
17283 sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
17284 measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.
17285 Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said
17286 his waterworks were out of order.
17287 
17288 Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O'Hanlon
17289 got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told
17290 Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
17291 flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could
17292 see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she
17293 swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he
17294 could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch
17295 or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands
17296 back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over
17297 her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against
17298 her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too
17299 was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes
17300 fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally
17301 worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a
17302 man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face.
17303 It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.
17304 
17305 Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
17306 noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
17307 because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
17308 to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied
17309 their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood
17310 up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the
17311 card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and
17312 Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her
17313 but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered
17314 with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about
17315 her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze
17316 shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt--O
17317 yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things
17318 like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.
17319 Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back
17320 the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully
17321 moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him
17322 better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex
17323 he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant
17324 there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were
17325 probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in
17326 sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.
17327 
17328 O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
17329 flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.
17330 
17331 Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
17332 ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young
17333 voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As
17334 for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
17335 him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
17336 much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen
17337 pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one
17338 look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss
17339 puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could
17340 see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering
17341 rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had
17342 struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
17343 something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
17344 never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it
17345 so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.
17346 
17347 Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in
17348 the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the
17349 sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him
17350 too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby
17351 looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy
17352 poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as
17353 much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to
17354 his brandnew dribbling bib.
17355 
17356 O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.
17357 
17358 The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set
17359 that little matter to rights.
17360 
17361 Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
17362 asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
17363 flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed
17364 it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction
17365 because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
17366 seashore because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
17367 Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the
17368 Blessed Sacrament in his hands.
17369 
17370 How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse
17371 of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same
17372 time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,
17373 thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of
17374 the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of
17375 paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter
17376 would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along
17377 by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the
17378 lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like
17379 she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of
17380 Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one
17381 knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from
17382 Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover
17383 to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable
17384 which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously
17385 neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the
17386 tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the
17387 eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change
17388 when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful
17389 thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely's of Dame
17390 Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only
17391 express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that
17392 she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the
17393 potherbs. _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J Walsh,
17394 Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou
17395 ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient
17396 loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that
17397 the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one
17398 shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an
17399 accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.
17400 But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there
17401 would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She
17402 would make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his
17403 thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his
17404 days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was
17405 dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife
17406 or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land
17407 of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.
17408 But even if--what then? Would it make a very great difference? From
17409 everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively
17410 recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the
17411 accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and
17412 coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and
17413 being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be
17414 just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other
17415 in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was
17416 an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She
17417 thought she understood. She would try to understand him because men were
17418 so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white
17419 hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would
17420 follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he
17421 was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was
17422 the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be
17423 wild, untrammelled, free.
17424 
17425 Canon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and
17426 genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then
17427 he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and
17428 Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't
17429 she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:
17430 
17431 O, look, Cissy!
17432 
17433 And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the
17434 trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.
17435 
17436 It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.
17437 
17438 And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
17439 helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy
17440 holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.
17441 
17442 Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.
17443 
17444 But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and
17445 call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could
17446 see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her
17447 pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and
17448 a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion
17449 silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left
17450 alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could
17451 be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible
17452 honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour
17453 went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were
17454 and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up
17455 and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her
17456 graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately
17457 rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse
17458 breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that,
17459 hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made
17460 her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with
17461 them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of
17462 papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do
17463 something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But
17464 this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was
17465 all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to
17466 his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there
17467 was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being
17468 married and there ought to be women priests that would understand
17469 without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy
17470 kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny
17471 Rippingham so mad about actors' photographs and besides it was on
17472 account of that other thing coming on the way it did.
17473 
17474 And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back
17475 and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and
17476 they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and
17477 she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was
17478 flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a
17479 long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense
17480 hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and
17481 higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,
17482 high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an
17483 entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things
17484 too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than
17485 those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being
17486 white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high
17487 it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from
17488 being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee
17489 where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed
17490 and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like that because he
17491 couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like
17492 those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he
17493 kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly,
17494 held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on
17495 her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled cry,
17496 wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a
17497 rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle
17498 burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures
17499 and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they
17500 shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so
17501 lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!
17502 
17503 Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She
17504 glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of
17505 piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl He
17506 was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he)
17507 stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a
17508 brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him
17509 and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been!
17510 He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,
17511 for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and
17512 wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their
17513 secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to
17514 know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening
17515 to and fro and little bats don't tell.
17516 
17517 Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show
17518 what a great person she was: and then she cried:
17519 
17520 Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.
17521 
17522 Gerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into
17523 her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of
17524 course without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too
17525 far to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet
17526 again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her
17527 dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls
17528 met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full
17529 of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She
17530 half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged
17531 on tears, and then they parted.
17532 
17533 Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,
17534 to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was
17535 darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and
17536 slippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic
17537 of her but with care and very slowly because--because Gerty MacDowell
17538 was...
17539 
17540 Tight boots? No. She's lame! O!
17541 
17542 Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That's why she's
17543 left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was
17544 wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse
17545 in a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was on
17546 show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn't mind. Curiosity like a
17547 nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate.
17548 Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such
17549 a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All
17550 kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent
17551 that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I
17552 suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she.
17553 Something in the air. That's the moon. But then why don't all women
17554 menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the
17555 time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of
17556 step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that.
17557 Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her silly I
17558 will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. That
17559 gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in the
17560 country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies.
17561 Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their
17562 natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.
17563 Reserve better. Don't want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O.
17564 Pity they can't see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was
17565 that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping
17566 Tom. Willy's hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those
17567 girls or is it all a fake? _Lingerie_ does it. Felt for the curves
17568 inside her _deshabilli._ Excites them also when they're. I'm all clean
17569 come and dirty me. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.
17570 Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse. At first. Put them all on to
17571 take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too:
17572 the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair
17573 of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was shining
17574 beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she
17575 takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to
17576 the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when
17577 you're on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as
17578 then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn't in a hurry either. Always
17579 off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on
17580 spec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the
17581 others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms
17582 round each other's necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and
17583 whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with
17584 whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,
17585 vindictive too for what they can't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and
17586 write to me. And I'll write to you. Now won't you? Molly and Josie
17587 Powell. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.
17588 Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?
17589 What have you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss,
17590 to see you. Picking holes in each other's appearance. You're looking
17591 splendid. Sister souls. Showing their teeth at one another. How many
17592 have you left? Wouldn't lend each other a pinch of salt.
17593 
17594 Ah!
17595 
17596 Devils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.
17597 Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my
17598 foot. O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest
17599 once in a way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one way.
17600 Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I
17601 read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she's
17602 a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt 1. When you feel like that you often
17603 meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a
17604 fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same
17605 and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers?
17606 Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss
17607 in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner
17608 have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair,
17609 lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to
17610 attend to my appearance my age. Didn't let her see me in profile. Still,
17611 you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the
17612 beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her
17613 hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know
17614 her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut.
17615 Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on the rocks in Holles
17616 street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice.
17617 She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I think so. All that for
17618 nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on
17619 that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to
17620 Drimmie's without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No,
17621 I remember. Richie Goulding: he's another. Weighs on his mind. Funny
17622 my watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to
17623 clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?
17624 
17625 O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.
17626 
17627 Ah!
17628 
17629 Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little
17630 limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant.
17631 Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented
17632 perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the
17633 kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have
17634 the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too.
17635 Amours_ of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.
17636 Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive
17637 bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength
17638 it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind
17639 the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't
17640 have. Makes you want to sing after. _Lacaus esant taratara_. Suppose I
17641 spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end
17642 the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if
17643 you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course
17644 if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. O
17645 but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O
17646 thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty
17647 things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It's
17648 so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit must
17649 be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave
17650 her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will
17651 squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you
17652 a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man
17653 from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get
17654 away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the
17655 Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in
17656 my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime,
17657 I don't think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is
17658 beginning. How they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask
17659 you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask
17660 you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.
17661 Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.
17662 Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want
17663 something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must
17664 have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since
17665 she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick.
17666 The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell
17667 by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till
17668 their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
17669 Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts
17670 were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we
17671 drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor
17672 had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.
17673 
17674 There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up
17675 like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must
17676 be, waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in
17677 mother's clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And
17678 the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could
17679 whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in
17680 Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling
17681 me the right time? I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane.
17682 Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.
17683 Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course
17684 they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.
17685 
17686 Didn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that
17687 satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine
17688 eyes she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not so
17689 much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond
17690 a dog's jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school
17691 drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that
17692 innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see
17693 them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_. Eyes all over them. Look under
17694 the bed for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives.
17695 Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of
17696 Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he
17697 had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger
17698 Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down
17699 from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for
17700 example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best
17701 place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a mirror. And when I sent
17702 her for Molly's Paisley shawl to Prescott's by the way that ad I must,
17703 carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never
17704 told her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing
17705 like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back
17706 when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the
17707 nurse taught me. O, don't they know! Three years old she was in front of
17708 Molly's dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have
17709 a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student.
17710 Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game.
17711 Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings,
17712 stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled
17713 stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.
17714 
17715 A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and
17716 zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and
17717 Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.
17718 Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling,
17719 I saw, your. I saw all.
17720 
17721 Lord!
17722 
17723 Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For
17724 this relief much thanks. In _Hamlet,_ that is. Lord! It was all things
17725 combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt
17726 of my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a
17727 worse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then
17728 I will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It
17729 couldn't be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like
17730 my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.
17731 
17732 Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in
17733 Irishtown._
17734 
17735 Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush
17736 Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if
17737 it understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw
17738 anything straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however
17739 because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping
17740 and papa's pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby
17741 when they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps
17742 them out of harm's way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.
17743 Children's hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even
17744 closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn't
17745 to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind.
17746 Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan
17747 there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the
17748 Coffee Palace. That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.
17749 And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst
17750 of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in
17751 drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in
17752 the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk
17753 last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home
17754 to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women's fault
17755 also. That's where Molly can knock spots off them. It's the blood of the
17756 south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent.
17757 Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton
17758 in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some
17759 kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a
17760 fellow's weak point in his wife. Still there's destiny in it, falling
17761 in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the
17762 dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls,
17763 height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them
17764 he matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought
17765 makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May
17766 and repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the
17767 foreskin is not back. Better detach.
17768 
17769 Ow!
17770 
17771 Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and
17772 the short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.
17773 Wristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic
17774 influence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I
17775 suppose, at once. Cat's away, the mice will play. I remember looking
17776 in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.
17777 Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.
17778 And time, well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing
17779 stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it's all
17780 arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the
17781 stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come.
17782 Come. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up
17783 and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you're
17784 a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you
17785 have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.
17786 
17787 Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third
17788 person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw
17789 stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at
17790 the horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west.
17791 Fine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like
17792 flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the
17793 paint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her
17794 slipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick
17795 the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all
17796 round over me and half down my back.
17797 
17798 Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave
17799 you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it?
17800 Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that
17801 kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,
17802 with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the
17803 dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She
17804 was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good
17805 conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection.
17806 For instance if you go into a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing
17807 too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,
17808 slow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains
17809 blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this
17810 morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine
17811 fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you
17812 call it gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as
17813 anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything
17814 she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little
17815 kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff
17816 in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.
17817 Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There
17818 or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes
17819 and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.
17820 Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs
17821 at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm.
17822 Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way.
17823 We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their
17824 period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like
17825 what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.
17826 
17827 Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long
17828 John had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink gives
17829 that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests
17830 that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies
17831 round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree
17832 of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to. That
17833 diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life. And
17834 it's extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.
17835 
17836 Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.
17837 Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that's the soap.
17838 
17839 O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never
17840 went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag
17841 this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could
17842 mention Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.
17843 Two and nine. Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do
17844 I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving
17845 credit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run
17846 up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into
17847 somewhere else.
17848 
17849 Here's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as
17850 far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a
17851 good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk
17852 a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk
17853 after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you
17854 learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don't
17855 mock what matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he
17856 now. _The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold
17857 Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow
17858 today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet
17859 however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say.
17860 Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels the
17861 atmosphere. Old Betty's joints are on the rack. Mother Shipton's
17862 prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling. No. Signs
17863 of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.
17864 
17865 Howth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or
17866 they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of
17867 the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds
17868 flash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt
17869 you. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through
17870 the small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.
17871 Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in
17872 the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv
17873 Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A
17874 star I see. Venus? Can't tell yet. Two. When three it's night. Were
17875 those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No.
17876 Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting
17877 sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land,
17878 goodnight.
17879 
17880 Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white
17881 fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his
17882 way up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,
17883 sore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the
17884 position. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't
17885 know how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green
17886 apples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it's the only time we cross
17887 legs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs
17888 under them. But it's the evening influence. They feel all that. Open
17889 like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in
17890 ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat
17891 Dillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length
17892 oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.
17893 History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm with you once again.
17894 Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her
17895 lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They
17896 take advantage.
17897 
17898 All quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The
17899 rhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the
17900 plumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:
17901 that's all. Lovers: yum yum.
17902 
17903 Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of
17904 me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it
17905 comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the
17906 same. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing
17907 new under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in
17908 your? Naughty darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house.
17909 Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy,
17910 Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old
17911 major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an
17912 only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself.
17913 Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he and she.
17914 Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in
17915 Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and
17916 periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the
17917 sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.
17918 All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty from the dew.
17919 
17920 Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a tree,
17921 so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could
17922 be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes.
17923 Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very
17924 likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him
17925 out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray
17926 for us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same
17927 thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there's the light in
17928 the priest's house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the
17929 valuation when I was in Thom's. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have.
17930 Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out
17931 at night like mice. They're a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice.
17932 What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct
17933 like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing
17934 in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny
17935 bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Colours depend
17936 on the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look
17937 at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his trademark on
17938 everything. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. Colour of
17939 brown turf. Say you never see them with three colours. Not true. That
17940 half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on
17941 her forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth a while ago amethyst.
17942 Glass flashing. That's how that wise man what's his name with the
17943 burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can't be tourists'
17944 matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and
17945 light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.
17946 Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not so bad.
17947 
17948 Ba. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last
17949 week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might
17950 be the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what
17951 they say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have
17952 to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph
17953 wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamers
17954 floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. _Faugh a
17955 Ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of
17956 a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy
17957 winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the
17958 earth somewhere. No ends really because it's round. Wife in every port
17959 they say. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching
17960 home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can
17961 they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor's weighed. Off he sails with
17962 a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no what's
17963 this they call it poor papa's father had on his door to touch. That
17964 brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.
17965 Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know
17966 what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life,
17967 lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that's the last of his nibs
17968 till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?
17969 
17970 Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,
17971 crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker, moon looking down so
17972 peaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.
17973 
17974 A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of
17975 funds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster
17976 of violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The
17977 shepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to
17978 house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock
17979 postman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through
17980 the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock
17981 lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal
17982 gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop
17983 press edition! Result of the Gold Cup race!_ and from the door of
17984 Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here,
17985 flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth
17986 settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was
17987 old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.
17988 He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing,
17989 slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship
17990 twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.
17991 
17992 Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish
17993 Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and
17994 breeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in
17995 the Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo.
17996 Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard
17997 to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces.
17998 Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don't know what
17999 death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they
18000 fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn't want to. Mamma!
18001 Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them
18002 up in the air to catch them. I'll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or
18003 children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns at each
18004 other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and
18005 nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better
18006 asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another
18007 themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so
18008 as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big.
18009 Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count
18010 my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see.
18011 Little paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine
18012 too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. Her
18013 growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when
18014 her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother
18015 too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista.
18016 O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all
18017 his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking
18018 out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.
18019 I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a
18020 private yacht. _Buenas noches, seqorita. El hombre ama la muchacha
18021 hermosa_. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.
18022 
18023 Better not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you
18024 dull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for
18025 Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital
18026 to see. Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral,
18027 house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that
18028 bawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what
18029 I said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No.
18030 Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in
18031 company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look
18032 at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant.
18033 Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked
18034 about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice
18035 old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of
18036 Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close
18037 range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But
18038 Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because
18039 you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish
18040 Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we're going to
18041 pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer's that
18042 looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on
18043 the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must
18044 wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man
18045 O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage.
18046 Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take
18047 him in tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette
18048 bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved,
18049 loved for ever, they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be
18050 handsome for tomorrow we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to
18051 find out who played the trick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also
18052 a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait.
18053 Something confused. She had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches.
18054 Suppose she does? Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer.
18055 Nannetti's gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad
18056 of Keyes's. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has
18057 something to put in them. What's that? Might be money.
18058 
18059 Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He
18060 brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go.
18061 Better. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and
18062 pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with
18063 story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children
18064 always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters.
18065 What's this? Bit of stick.
18066 
18067 O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here
18068 tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do.
18069 Will I?
18070 
18071 Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a
18072 message for her. Might remain. What?
18073 
18074 I.
18075 
18076 Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide
18077 comes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark
18078 mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and
18079 letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the
18080 meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not
18081 like.
18082 
18083 AM. A.
18084 
18085 No room. Let it go.
18086 
18087 Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.
18088 Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here.
18089 Except Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by
18090 design.
18091 
18092 He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now
18093 if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance.
18094 We'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made
18095 me feel so young.
18096 
18097 Short snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone..
18098 Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I
18099 won't go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes
18100 a moment. Won't sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat
18101 again. No harm in him. Just a few.
18102 
18103 O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do

18110 
18111 A bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom
18112 with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just
18113 for a few
18114

18118 
18119 The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest's house cooed where Canon
18120 O'Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S. J. were
18121 taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup
18122 and talking about

18129 to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there
18130 because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty
18131 MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was

18147 Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive
18148 concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by
18149 mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that
18150 which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in
18151 them high mind's ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain
18152 when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being
18153 equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more
18154 efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may
18155 have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent
18156 continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately
18157 present constitutes the certain sign of omnipotent nature's incorrupted
18158 benefaction. For who is there who anything of some significance has
18159 apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the
18160 surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone
18161 so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon
18162 can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just
18163 citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and
18164 to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently
18165 commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence
18166 accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced
18167 the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of
18168 profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the
18169 hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone
18170 be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously
18171 command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance
18172 or with diminution's menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating
18173 function ever irrevocably enjoined?
18174 
18175 It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians
18176 relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature
18177 admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.
18178 Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves,
18179 their greatest doctors, the O'Shiels, the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees,
18180 have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the
18181 relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling
18182 withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every public work which
18183 in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance
18184 commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having
18185 preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in
18186 being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not
18187 up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so
18188 far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient
18189 in that all hardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely
18190 for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently
18191 moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and
18192 for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.
18193 
18194 To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be
18195 molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent
18196 mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received
18197 eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the
18198 case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying
18199 desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be
18200 received into that domicile. O thing of prudent nation not merely in
18201 being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that
18202 they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly
18203 to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!
18204 
18205 Before born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that
18206 one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with
18207 wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were
18208 now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs
18209 there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her
18210 case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various
18211 latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine
18212 and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence
18213 conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of
18214 mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her
18215 thereto to lie in, her term up.
18216 
18217 Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming. Of
18218 Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark
18219 ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.
18220 
18221 Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming
18222 mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale
18223 so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters
18224 in ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons
18225 thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding
18226 wariest ward.
18227 
18228 In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising
18229 with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping
18230 lightens in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin. Full she drad that
18231 God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.
18232 Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe
18233 infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in
18234 Horne's house.
18235 
18236 Loth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he
18237 ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land
18238 and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe
18239 meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with
18240 good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so
18241 young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes
18242 his word winning.
18243 
18244 As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad
18245 after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor tidings
18246 sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare
18247 Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so
18248 heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for
18249 friend so young, algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay.
18250 She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with
18251 masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs.
18252 The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was
18253 died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island
18254 through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God
18255 the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her
18256 sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in
18257 wanhope sorrowing one with other.
18258 
18259 Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the
18260 dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came
18261 naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the
18262 last for to go as he came.
18263 
18264 The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and
18265 he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.
18266 The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes
18267 now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear
18268 but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had
18269 seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's
18270 birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man
18271 that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words
18272 for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of
18273 motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for
18274 any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine
18275 twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.
18276 
18277 And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed
18278 them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came
18279 against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And
18280 the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they
18281 had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this
18282 learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be
18283 healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a
18284 horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make
18285 a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he
18286 said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with
18287 them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go
18288 otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady
18289 was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well
18290 that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But
18291 the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have
18292 him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous
18293 castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him
18294 for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers
18295 lands and sometime venery.
18296 
18297 And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
18298 and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not
18299 move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and
18300 knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white
18301 flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there
18302 abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of
18303 Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he
18304 blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on
18305 the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was
18306 a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange
18307 fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible
18308 thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie
18309 in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness
18310 that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And also it was
18311 a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of
18312 fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits
18313 that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And
18314 they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks
18315 out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a
18316 brewage like to mead.
18317 
18318 And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
18319 thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe
18320 Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat
18321 in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and
18322 anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and
18323 his neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with
18324 them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.
18325 
18326 This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the
18327 reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for
18328 there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied
18329 fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what
18330 cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it
18331 be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw
18332 a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than
18333 any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the
18334 one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full
18335 gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His
18336 bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.
18337 And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her
18338 next. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never
18339 none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully
18340 delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for
18341 he was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the
18342 goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall and that was the meekest
18343 man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was
18344 the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service
18345 to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman's woe with wonder
18346 pondering.
18347 
18348 Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
18349 drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side
18350 the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's
18351 with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the
18352 franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and
18353 young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board
18354 and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of
18355 him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the
18356 most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir
18357 Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have
18358 come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.
18359 And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon
18360 and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him
18361 there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that
18362 time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to
18363 wander, loth to leave.
18364 
18365 For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen
18366 other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that
18367 put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a
18368 matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that
18369 now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her
18370 death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And
18371 they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said,
18372 the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of
18373 this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had
18374 conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch
18375 were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never
18376 other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his
18377 judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said
18378 but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife
18379 should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot
18380 upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the
18381 franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the
18382 least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole
18383 affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by
18384 rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of
18385 Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were
18386 all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following:
18387 Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now
18388 glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.
18389 But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly
18390 impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord
18391 and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means
18392 to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.
18393 Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had
18394 overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he
18395 would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if
18396 it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat
18397 Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi's praise of that beast the
18398 unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all
18399 this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice
18400 him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that
18401 he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat
18402 laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which
18403 never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would
18404 not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might
18405 be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church
18406 that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith,
18407 patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness
18408 or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the
18409 influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie
18410 with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or
18411 peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses
18412 Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul
18413 was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God's
18414 greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear
18415 beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's
18416 seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages
18417 founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like
18418 case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of
18419 mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said
18420 dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever
18421 loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his
18422 experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother
18423 Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort
18424 deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon,
18425 and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a
18426 marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor
18427 lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and
18428 that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.
18429 
18430 But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
18431 pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour
18432 and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
18433 manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
18434 could save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart
18435 for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of
18436 lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and
18437 lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir
18438 Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his
18439 friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and
18440 as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all
18441 accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure
18442 for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
18443 murdered his goods with whores.
18444 
18445 About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
18446 so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed
18447 their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for
18448 the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the
18449 vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we,
18450 quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel
18451 of my body but my soul's bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them
18452 that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this
18453 will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed
18454 them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of
18455 two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he
18456 writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of
18457 money as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know
18458 all men, he said, time's ruins build eternity's mansions. What means
18459 this? Desire's wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a
18460 bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark me now. In woman's
18461 womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh
18462 that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This is the
18463 postcreation. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. No question but her name is
18464 puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd,
18465 our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly
18466 that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an
18467 almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won
18468 us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are
18469 linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all,
18470 seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter
18471 now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her
18472 creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and
18473 then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who
18474 lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of
18475 the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M. Lio Taxil nous
18476 a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'itait le
18477 sacre pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality ODER
18478 consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried out
18479 upon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a
18480 birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.
18481 Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we
18482 withstand, withsay.
18483 
18484 Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would
18485 sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod
18486 of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:
18487 The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse
18488 Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor
18489 was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all
18490 orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that
18491 no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an
18492 ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking,
18493 in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her
18494 hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them
18495 all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and
18496 shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode
18497 with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou
18498 chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling,
18499 thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up
18500 his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir
18501 Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain
18502 gentle, advising also the time's occasion as most sacred and most worthy
18503 to be most sacred. In Horne's house rest should reign.
18504 
18505 To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
18506 Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
18507 had not cided to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the
18508 womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master
18509 Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds
18510 and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue
18511 of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all
18512 intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he
18513 said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was
18514 the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and
18515 they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and
18516 deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she
18517 to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with
18518 burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and
18519 the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was
18520 there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those
18521 delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is
18522 in their _Maid's Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:
18523 To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable
18524 concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most
18525 mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous
18526 flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium
18527 of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,
18528 but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher
18529 for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said
18530 indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them
18531 and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran
18532 very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.
18533 Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his
18534 wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that
18535 effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters
18536 to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom
18537 mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will
18538 go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. _Orate, fratres, pro
18539 memetipso_. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy
18540 generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by
18541 my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication
18542 in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou
18543 sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of
18544 servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why
18545 hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for
18546 a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of
18547 dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now,
18548 my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and
18549 from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk
18550 and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my
18551 sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for ever
18552 in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou
18553 kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say,
18554 hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as
18555 mentioned for the Orient from on high Which brake hell's gates visited a
18556 darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully
18557 saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no
18558 blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt's
18559 plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their
18560 most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_. And as the ends and ultimates of
18561 all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and
18562 originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth
18563 from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing
18564 and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it
18565 with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail,
18566 batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they
18567 bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed
18568 of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted
18569 sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as
18570 no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall
18571 thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way
18572 is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness
18573 the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.
18574 
18575 Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly
18576 bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic
18577 longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie
18578 order, a penny for him who finds the pea.
18579 
18580      _Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack
18581      See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,
18582      In the proud cirque of Jackjohn's bivouac._
18583 
18584 A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on
18585 left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm
18586 that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and
18587 witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And
18588 he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all
18589 mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift
18590 was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the
18591 cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some
18592 mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which
18593 Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and
18594 a blow on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an
18595 old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would
18596 not lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as
18597 cowed he crouched in Horne's hall. He drank indeed at one draught to
18598 pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all
18599 the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked
18600 him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the
18601 braggart's side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear,
18602 advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard,
18603 the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken
18604 place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.
18605 
18606 But was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? No, for he
18607 had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
18608 done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
18609 other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But
18610 could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the
18611 bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not
18612 there to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the
18613 god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard?
18614 Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube
18615 Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that
18616 he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die
18617 as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to
18618 die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor
18619 would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon
18620 has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that
18621 other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise
18622 which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there
18623 is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall
18624 come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and
18625 Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he
18626 fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she
18627 said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true
18628 path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn
18629 aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so
18630 flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush
18631 or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.
18632 
18633 This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse
18634 of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore
18635 Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a
18636 wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and
18637 know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else
18638 but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,
18639 Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and
18640 in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words
18641 printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by
18642 Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they
18643 cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of
18644 oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring
18645 that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was
18646 named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr
18647 Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,
18648 Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company,
18649 were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a
18650 very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and
18651 spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them
18652 contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.
18653 
18654 So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
18655 after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a
18656 fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields
18657 athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.
18658 Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle
18659 this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds
18660 all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag
18661 and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for
18662 aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the
18663 land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and
18664 by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the
18665 west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the
18666 weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and
18667 after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and
18668 in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking
18669 shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or
18670 kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the
18671 pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn, thence through
18672 Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was
18673 before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but
18674 no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice
18675 Fitzgibbon's door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the
18676 college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come
18677 from Mr Moore's the writer's (that was a papish but is now, folk say,
18678 a good Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are
18679 now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from
18680 Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M's brother will stay a
18681 month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,
18682 he bound home and he to Andrew Horne's being stayed for to crush a cup
18683 of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of
18684 her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and
18685 so both together on to Horne's. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford's journal
18686 sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun.,
18687 scholar of my lady of Mercy's, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden,
18688 T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom
18689 there for a languor he had but was now better, be having dreamed tonight
18690 a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of
18691 Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and
18692 Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now
18693 on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put
18694 to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a
18695 shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good
18696 and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her
18697 soon issue. 'Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off
18698 her last chick's nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three
18699 all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king's bible.
18700 Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to
18701 be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour
18702 dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has
18703 trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum
18704 an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase
18705 the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come
18706 for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell
18707 has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish
18708 for his farmer's gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere
18709 fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes
18710 they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.
18711 
18712 With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter
18713 was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him
18714 for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on
18715 Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near
18716 by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that
18717 went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women,
18718 horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean
18719 in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses
18720 and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men, runners,
18721 flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the
18722 game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights
18723 till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose
18724 gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten
18725 into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare
18726 tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue,
18727 some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of
18728 them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this
18729 talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was
18730 his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of
18731 the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their
18732 bully beef, a pox on it. There's as good fish in this tin as ever came
18733 out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that
18734 stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place
18735 which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.
18736 Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been
18737 indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he
18738 spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been
18739 a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to
18740 school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at
18741 the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his
18742 teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the
18743 parish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor,
18744 then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit
18745 and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on
18746 the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of
18747 moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He
18748 had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked
18749 pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint
18750 of tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands
18751 across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter
18752 all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool
18753 boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had
18754 experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and
18755 wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe,
18756 a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow
18757 auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. I question with
18758 you there, says he. More like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr
18759 Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and
18760 that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking
18761 him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the
18762 bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to
18763 take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.
18764 He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a
18765 bull that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr
18766 Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English
18767 chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was
18768 sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them
18769 all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent
18770 cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper
18771 and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns
18772 galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of
18773 his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
18774 rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.
18775 What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
18776 that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
18777 were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my
18778 cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and
18779 with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the
18780 blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him
18781 a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to
18782 this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper
18783 in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his
18784 long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in
18785 the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they
18786 dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and
18787 girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him
18788 all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of
18789 the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market
18790 so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. By this time the
18791 father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that
18792 he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and
18793 damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his
18794 belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their
18795 ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language
18796 and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he
18797 would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself
18798 for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up
18799 on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying:
18800 By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And,
18801 says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or
18802 the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much
18803 as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half
18804 the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all
18805 by lord Harry's orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says
18806 Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks
18807 in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house
18808 and I'll meddle in his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell
18809 hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But
18810 one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal
18811 pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for
18812 himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row
18813 with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull
18814 and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry
18815 he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous
18816 champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for
18817 boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his
18818 head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers
18819 and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the
18820 water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had
18821 belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language
18822 to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal
18823 pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went
18824 out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what
18825 took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of
18826 cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as
18827 fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and
18828 the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as
18829 the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded
18830 themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts
18831 erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three
18832 sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor,
18833 ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the
18834 bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover
18835 the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the
18836 composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:
18837 
18838      _--Pope Peter's but a pissabed.
18839      A man's a man for a' that._
18840 
18841 Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway
18842 as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend
18843 whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
18844 who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a
18845 cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil
18846 enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
18847 project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
18848 on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
18849 which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend
18850 printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator.
18851 Lambay Island_. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw
18852 from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir
18853 Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself
18854 to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well,
18855 let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it
18856 smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as cheap sitting as
18857 standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon
18858 his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by
18859 a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the
18860 prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal
18861 vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the
18862 prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities
18863 acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch
18864 defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable
18865 females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their
18866 flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly
18867 bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might
18868 multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of
18869 their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he
18870 assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which
18871 he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with
18872 certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had
18873 resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay
18874 island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of
18875 note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up
18876 there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk
18877 hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful
18878 yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life
18879 soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the
18880 functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he
18881 take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the
18882 opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers
18883 were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.
18884 For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a
18885 diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
18886 latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
18887 broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
18888 chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
18889 asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with
18890 which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the
18891 rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be
18892 observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now
18893 somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained
18894 by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of
18895 Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also
18896 to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the
18897 scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt
18898 upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his
18899 contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites,
18900 ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
18901 titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
18902 centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder
18903 wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more
18904 suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the
18905 farmyard drake and duck.
18906 
18907 Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
18908 man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
18909 animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
18910 while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
18911 advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
18912 passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
18913 nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom
18914 were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
18915 a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
18916 assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
18917 heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was
18918 come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an
18919 interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched
18920 a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon,
18921 to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
18922 his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
18923 ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
18924 as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.
18925 For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote
18926 himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll
18927 mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though
18928 'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard.
18929 This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw
18930 the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry
18931 rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the
18932 antechamber.
18933 
18934 Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little
18935 fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
18936 with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
18937 point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
18938 obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by
18939 a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had
18940 not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
18941 contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever
18942 done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _Mais bien s{r_,
18943 noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. That you may
18944 and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my
18945 felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet
18946 and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and
18947 find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to
18948 the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good
18949 things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a
18950 complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his
18951 bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
18952 picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.
18953 Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he
18954 said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting
18955 instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her
18956 feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so
18957 melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been
18958 impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of
18959 such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so
18960 touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!
18961 Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
18962 favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
18963 replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.
18964 Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great
18965 and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in
18966 thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb,
18967 the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer
18968 years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and
18969 imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in
18970 anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my
18971 cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured
18972 seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,
18973 he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and,
18974 thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz,
18975 from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion
18976 as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur,
18977 tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller
18978 I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI in a circle of the best wits
18979 of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they
18980 have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A
18981 drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more
18982 than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.
18983 Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a
18984 sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten
18985 such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me
18986 today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in
18987 such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and
18988 whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy
18989 butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in
18990 our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_
18991 for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a
18992 breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The
18993 first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her
18994 tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer
18995 chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell
18996 tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for
18997 the enrichment of our store of knowledge.
18998 
18999 Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
19000 all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
19001 having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with
19002 a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a
19003 party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and
19004 not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of
19005 the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
19006 ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.
19007 A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused
19008 you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad's bud, immensely
19009 so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater
19010 hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the
19011 chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid
19012 there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young
19013 blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest
19014 squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless
19015 me, I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father
19016 Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried
19017 Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a
19018 white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however,
19019 rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just
19020 then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence
19021 had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was
19022 enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had
19023 given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those
19024 who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling
19025 profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest
19026 power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if
19027 need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of
19028 her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a
19029 glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What?
19030 Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of
19031 her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most
19032 momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I
19033 shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice
19034 have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and
19035 maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he
19036 saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur
19037 of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker
19038 without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would
19039 he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his
19040 transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a
19041 round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew
19042 breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of
19043 honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy
19044 father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty
19045 pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.
19046 
19047 To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of
19048 some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
19049 of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not
19050 pity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies
19051 as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions
19052 were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
19053 outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
19054 they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
19055 strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello
19056 was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that
19057 seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out
19058 of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the
19059 world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed
19060 a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
19061 creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now
19062 for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed
19063 through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary
19064 ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart
19065 to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them
19066 with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude
19067 of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find
19068 tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the
19069 cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold
19070 with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit
19071 the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost
19072 all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of
19073 experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious
19074 retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring
19075 nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever
19076 as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the
19077 tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any
19078 condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful
19079 occasions. To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned
19080 upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little
19081 alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an
19082 ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to
19083 the bounty of the Supreme Being.
19084 
19085 Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
19086 his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express
19087 one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not
19088 to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement
19089 since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy
19090 young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation
19091 or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I
19092 must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to
19093 evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round
19094 again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his
19095 nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I
19096 bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.
19097 'Slife, I'll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of
19098 the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell
19099 to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young
19100 blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had
19101 been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or
19102 an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular,
19103 communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of
19104 metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the
19105 dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the
19106 mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a
19107 pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of
19108 an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But,
19109 he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in
19110 common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a
19111 feather laugh together.
19112 
19113 But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
19114 has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
19115 to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our
19116 internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
19117 counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
19118 advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
19119 moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant
19120 at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he
19121 forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from
19122 being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is,
19123 if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from
19124 candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of
19125 a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her
19126 virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his
19127 interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been
19128 too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to
19129 listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of
19130 the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his
19131 piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt
19132 illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata
19133 of society! Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary
19134 angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the
19135 question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in
19136 Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing
19137 retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill
19138 becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield
19139 that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible
19140 at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must
19141 dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste
19142 to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his
19143 practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His
19144 marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant
19145 to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for
19146 a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and
19147 healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in
19148 its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm
19149 but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
19150 quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid
19151 and inoperative.
19152 
19153 The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
19154 usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the
19155 junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the
19156 delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself
19157 to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the
19158 afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic
19159 affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous
19160 exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and
19161 solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would
19162 palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
19163 obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
19164 tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
19165 to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the
19166 display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among
19167 tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively
19168 eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean
19169 section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form,
19170 with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs
19171 Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate
19172 Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the
19173 rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets,
19174 miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac
19175 foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia
19176 of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in
19177 consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial
19178 line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the
19179 benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour
19180 pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the
19181 premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the
19182 actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial
19183 insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent
19184 upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in
19185 the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing
19186 manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the
19187 recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births
19188 conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in
19189 a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified
19190 in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest
19191 problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much
19192 animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as
19193 the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest,
19194 by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and
19195 the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and
19196 ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her
19197 person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.
19198 The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's
19199 inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a
19200 prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded
19201 the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired
19202 infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced
19203 by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of
19204 the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic
19205 development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish
19206 delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost
19207 carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males
19208 of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables
19209 such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet
19210 has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression
19211 made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily
19212 as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in
19213 that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect,
19214 postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.
19215 Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate
19216 Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological
19217 dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other,
19218 the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom
19219 for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent,
19220 whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity
19221 of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward
19222 voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the
19223 ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has
19224 joined.
19225 
19226 But Malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the
19227 scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and
19228 in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh
19229 creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the
19230 other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted
19231 on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some
19232 such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems,
19233 history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel
19234 Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This
19235 is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting
19236 at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back
19237 with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a
19238 bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland's, is in this life. It is what I tried
19239 to obliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language
19240 he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping
19241 out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah!
19242 Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the
19243 panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite
19244 and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was
19245 gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer
19246 raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The
19247 sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy
19248 without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias,
19249 overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the
19250 third brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself
19251 the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this
19252 relief much thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.
19253 No soul will live there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude.
19254 The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted.
19255 Murderer's ground.
19256 
19257 What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the
19258 chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the
19259 merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as
19260 her mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing
19261 the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a
19262 modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is
19263 young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within
19264 a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then
19265 is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old
19266 house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on
19267 him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's
19268 thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first
19269 hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged
19270 traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented
19271 handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas!
19272 a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this
19273 or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for
19274 a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his
19275 studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark
19276 eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission
19277 to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob's pipe after like labours in
19278 the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating),
19279 reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a
19280 month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young
19281 knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the
19282 mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his
19283 sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a
19284 drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the
19285 first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine
19286 and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear
19287 the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal
19288 university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever
19289 remember the night: first night, the bridenight. They are entwined
19290 in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant
19291 fiat_!) light shall flood the world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay,
19292 fair reader. In a breath 'twas done but--hold! Back! It must not be! In
19293 terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She is the bride of
19294 darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe
19295 of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful
19296 illusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain. No son of thy
19297 loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was
19298 for Rudolph.
19299 
19300 The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the
19301 infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions
19302 of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight
19303 ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her
19304 dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with
19305 ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms
19306 are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely
19307 haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They
19308 fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of
19309 screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And
19310 on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion,
19311 the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads
19312 them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and
19313 yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come
19314 trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous revengeful zodiacal
19315 host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the
19316 trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter
19317 and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning
19318 multitude, murderers of the sun.
19319 
19320 Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
19321 gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent
19322 grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own
19323 magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder
19324 of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the
19325 daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one,
19326 Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now
19327 arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour,
19328 shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call
19329 it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it
19330 streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents
19331 of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling,
19332 writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad
19333 metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign
19334 upon the forehead of Taurus.
19335 
19336 Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
19337 school together in Conmee's time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
19338 Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the
19339 past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them
19340 into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to
19341 my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending
19342 bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair
19343 with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those
19344 leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
19345 more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius
19346 father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see
19347 you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I
19348 heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying
19349 a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his
19350 mother an orphan. The young man's face grew dark. All could see how hard
19351 it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He
19352 would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed
19353 the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the
19354 rider's name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag
19355 fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. Madden
19356 up. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis
19357 could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah!
19358 Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close
19359 order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All
19360 was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she
19361 cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright
19362 casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A
19363 tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane.
19364 Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount
19365 him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter
19366 is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the
19367 luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly
19368 that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad,
19369 sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could
19370 have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant
19371 Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of
19372 muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded
19373 us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with
19374 pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have
19375 cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that
19376 Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought
19377 for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled
19378 mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four
19379 days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.
19380 She is more taking then. Her posies tool Mad romp that she is, she had
19381 pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you
19382 will not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was
19383 walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not,
19384 a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet
19385 creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a
19386 slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the
19387 very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely
19388 echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going
19389 by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had
19390 poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
19391 propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
19392 withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.
19393 Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far
19394 away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
19395 born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
19396 incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos
19397 told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian
19398 priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the
19399 moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha
19400 of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these
19401 were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
19402 constellation.
19403 
19404 However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
19405 being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which
19406 was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was
19407 not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above
19408 was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of
19409 animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody
19410 that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty
19411 speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts
19412 he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled
19413 by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated
19414 amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was
19415 certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its
19416 scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently
19417 transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an
19418 altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment
19419 before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two
19420 or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as
19421 mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both
19422 their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was
19423 endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined
19424 to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the
19425 mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and
19426 made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the
19427 same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not
19428 to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.
19429 
19430 The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
19431 course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The
19432 debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
19433 the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never
19434 beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the
19435 old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
19436 encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at
19437 the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing
19438 from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him,
19439 was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity
19440 and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to
19441 Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose
19442 the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant
19443 before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in
19444 explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted
19445 sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi
19446 Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young
19447 poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical
19448 inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while
19449 to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator,
19450 fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the
19451 dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible
19452 dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril
19453 or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous
19454 loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages
19455 yet to come.
19456 
19457 It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
19458 transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions
19459 would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to
19460 accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated,
19461 deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the
19462 street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain
19463 them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which
19464 science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted
19465 by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.
19466 Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary
19467 the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth
19468 of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the
19469 differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to
19470 opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig,
19471 Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to
19472 a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the _nisus
19473 formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily
19474 chosen position, _succubitus felix_ of the passive element. The other
19475 problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant
19476 mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we
19477 are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M.
19478 Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which
19479 our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by
19480 inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged,
19481 and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity
19482 posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers
19483 and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of
19484 dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he
19485 said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of
19486 the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted
19487 and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature,
19488 light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of
19489 the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured
19490 photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable
19491 ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months
19492 in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes
19493 some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers
19494 subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in
19495 the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official,
19496 culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal
19497 abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former
19498 we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he
19499 cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity
19500 is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the
19501 wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they
19502 do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which
19503 often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is
19504 that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and
19505 mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements,
19506 lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in
19507 fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun
19508 to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our
19509 public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.
19510 Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy
19511 parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs
19512 unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same
19513 marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause.
19514 Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for
19515 whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law
19516 of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken
19517 up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the
19518 plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an
19519 increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though
19520 productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is
19521 nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the
19522 race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S.
19523 Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?)
19524 that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and
19525 apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect
19526 imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females
19527 emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak
19528 of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric
19529 relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought
19530 else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.
19531 For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with
19532 the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and
19533 embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things
19534 scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides
19535 himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in
19536 the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the
19537 cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In
19538 a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took
19539 place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30
19540 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in
19541 Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported
19542 by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat
19543 into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most
19544 complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual
19545 congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it,
19546 to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of
19547 his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured
19548 tone in which it was delivered.
19549 
19550 Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
19551 happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient
19552 and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave
19553 woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and
19554 now she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone
19555 before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching
19556 scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight
19557 in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is
19558 to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent
19559 prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her
19560 loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have
19561 her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that
19562 mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now
19563 you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet
19564 in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious
19565 second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady,
19566 loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that
19567 faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she
19568 recalls those days. God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But
19569 their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers
19570 and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy,
19571 Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little
19572 Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs
19573 of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a
19574 Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful
19575 will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of
19576 Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle. And so
19577 time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh
19578 break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from
19579 your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for
19580 you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read
19581 in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil
19582 heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You
19583 too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir,
19584 to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!
19585 
19586 There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil
19587 memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart
19588 but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim,
19589 let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself
19590 that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will
19591 call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the
19592 most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel
19593 and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the
19594 evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.
19595 Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under
19596 her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded
19597 in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.
19598 
19599 The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of
19600 that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied
19601 trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
19602 unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene
19603 disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by
19604 a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present
19605 there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space
19606 of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at
19607 Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but
19608 with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over
19609 the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert
19610 shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times
19611 in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey,
19612 Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in
19613 her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent
19614 from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily
19615 against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey
19616 blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long
19617 the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by
19618 that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young
19619 man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but
19620 must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the
19621 PIAZZETTA giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness
19622 or of reproach (_alles Vergangliche_) in her glad look.
19623 
19624 Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that
19625 antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their
19626 faces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of
19627 custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant
19628 watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long
19629 ago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with
19630 preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,
19631 compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field
19632 and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an
19633 instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the
19634 thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the
19635 transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the
19636 word.
19637 
19638 Burke's! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and
19639 bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,
19640 punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,
19641 ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and
19642 what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse
19643 Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon
19644 coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a
19645 milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out,
19646 tumultuously, off for a minute's race, all bravely legging it, Burke's
19647 of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them
19648 sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with
19649 nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up
19650 there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward
19651 of watching in Horne's house has told its tale in that washedout pallor.
19652 Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in
19653 going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?
19654 
19655 The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence
19656 celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._
19657 God's air, the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.
19658 Breathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a
19659 doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor
19660 barring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle.
19661 Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which
19662 thou hast fructified with thy modicum of man's work. Cleave to her!
19663 Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all
19664 Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore. Art drooping
19665 under thy load, bemoiled with butcher's bills at home and ingots (not
19666 thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every newbegotten thou shalt
19667 gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy
19668 Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A canting jay and a rheumeyed
19669 curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead
19670 gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer.
19671 Copulation without population! No, say I! Herod's slaughter of the
19672 innocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile
19673 cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary
19674 pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever,
19675 bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious
19676 attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. A truce to threnes and
19677 trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! Twenty
19678 years of it, regret them not. With thee it was not as with many that
19679 will and would and wait and never--do. Thou sawest thy America, thy
19680 lifetask, and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison. How
19681 saith Zarathustra? _Deine Kuh Tr|bsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die
19682 s|sse Milch des Euters_. See! it displodes for thee in abundance. Drink,
19683 man, an udderful! Mother's milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk
19684 too of those burgeoning stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour,
19685 punch milk, such as those rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk
19686 of madness, the honeymilk of Canaan's land. Thy cow's dug was tough,
19687 what? Ay, but her milk is hot and sweet and fattening. No dollop this
19688 but thick rich bonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch! Pap! _Per deam
19689 Partulam et Pertundam nunc est bibendum_!
19690 
19691 All off for a buster, armstrong, hollering down the street. Bonafides.

19809 Trumpery insanity. Bartle the Bread we calls him. That, sir, was once

19846 yanked to glory most half this planet from Frisco beach to Vladivostok.
19847 The Deity aint no nickel dime bumshow. I put it to you that He's on the
19848 square and a corking fine business proposition. He's the grandest thing
19849 yet and don't you forget it. Shout salvation in King Jesus. You'll
19850 need to rise precious early you sinner there, if you want to diddle the
19851 Almighty God. Pflaaaap! Not half. He's got a coughmixture with a punch
19852 in it for you, my friend, in his back pocket. Just you try it on.
19853 
19854 
19855 
19856 The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches
19857 an uncobbled tramsiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green
19858 will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of grimy houses with gaping
19859 doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fins. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice
19860 gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which
19861 are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly.
19862 Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the
19863 murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer._
19864 
19865 THE CALLS: Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.
19866 
19867 THE ANSWERS: Round behind the stable.
19868 
19869 A deafmute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling,
19870 jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children 's hands
19871 imprisons him.)_
19872 
19873 THE CHILDREN: Kithogue! Salute!
19874 
19875 THE IDIOT: _(Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles)_ Grhahute!
19876 
19877 THE CHILDREN: Where's the great light?
19878 
19879 THE IDIOT: _(Gobbing)_ Ghaghahest.
19880 
19881 They release him. He jerks on. A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung
19882 between two railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and
19883 muffled by its arm and hat snores, groans, grinding growling teeth, and
19884 snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches
19885 to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky
19886 oillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his
19887 booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone
19888 makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the
19889 doorstep with a paper shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts,
19890 clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands
19891 the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a comer two night watch in
19892 shouldercapes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate
19893 crashes: a woman screams: a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter,
19894 cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a
19895 candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair
19896 of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill
19897 from a lane.)_
19898 
19899 CISSY CAFFREY:
19900 
19901      _I gave it to Molly
19902      Because she was jolly,
19903      The leg of the duck,
19904      The leg of the duck._
19905 
19906 Private Carr and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters,
19907 as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their
19908 mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago
19909 retorts.)_
19910 
19911 THE VIRAGO: Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.
19912 
19913 CISSY CAFFREY: More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet. _(She
19914 sings)_
19915 
19916      _I gave it to Nelly
19917      To stick in her belly,
19918      The leg of the duck,
19919      The leg of the duck._
19920 
19921 Private Carr and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics
19922 bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond cropped
19923 polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the
19924 redcoats.)_
19925 
19926 PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Jerks his finger)_ Way for the parson.
19927 
19928 PRIVATE CARR: _(Turns and calls)_ What ho, parson!
19929 
19930 CISSY CAFFREY: _(Her voice soaring higher)_
19931 
19932      _She has it, she got it,
19933      Wherever she put it,
19934      The leg of the duck._
19935 
19936 Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy
19937 the_ introit _for paschal time. Lynch, his jockeycap low on his brow,
19938 attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)_
19939 
19940 STEPHEN: _Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia_.
19941 
19942 The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a
19943 doorway.)_
19944 
19945 THE BAWD: _(Her voice whispering huskily)_ Sst! Come here till I tell
19946 you. Maidenhead inside. Sst!
19947 
19948 STEPHEN: _(Altius aliquantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit aqua ista_.
19949 
19950 THE BAWD: _(Spits in their trail her jet of venom)_ Trinity medicals.
19951 Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.
19952 
19953 Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with bertha supple, draws her shawl
19954 across her nostrils.)_
19955 
19956 EDY BOARDMAN: _(Bickering)_ And says the one: I seen you up Faithful
19957 place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his
19958 cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You
19959 never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The
19960 likes of her! Stag that one is! Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with
19961 two fellows the one time, Kilbride, the enginedriver, and lancecorporal
19962 Oliphant.
19963 
19964 STEPHEN: _(Ttriumphaliter) Salvi facti sunt._
19965 
19966 He flourishes his ashplant, shivering the lamp image, shattering light
19967 over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him,
19968 growling. Lynch scares it with a kick.)_
19969 
19970 LYNCH: So that?
19971 
19972 STEPHEN: (_Looks behind_) So that gesture, not music not odour, would be
19973 a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay
19974 sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.
19975 
19976 LYNCH: Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburgh street!
19977 
19978 STEPHEN: We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even
19979 the allwisest Stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of
19980 love.
19981 
19982 LYNCH: Ba!
19983 
19984 STEPHEN: Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug?
19985 This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread or wine in Omar.
19986 Hold my stick.
19987 
19988 LYNCH: Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?
19989 
19990 STEPHEN: Lecherous lynx, _to la belle dame sans merci,_ Georgina
19991 Johnson, _ad deam qui laetificat iuventutem meam._
19992 
19993 Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands,
19994 his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down
19995 turned, in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left
19996 being higher.)_
19997 
19998 LYNCH: Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the
19999 customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.
20000 
20001 They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs
20002 in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to
20003 climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the
20004 dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his
20005 nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot.
20006 Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring
20007 cresset._
20008 
20009 Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools,
20010 middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south
20011 beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy, staggering forward,
20012 cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding on the farther side
20013 under the railway bridge bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming bread
20014 and chocolate into a sidepocket. From Gillen's hairdresser's window a
20015 composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror
20016 at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave
20017 Gladstone sees him level, Bloom for Bloom. he passes, struck by the
20018 stare of truculent Wellington, but in the convex mirror grin unstruck
20019 the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy._
20020 
20021 At Antonio Pabaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright
20022 arclamp. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)_
20023 
20024 BLOOM: Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!
20025 
20026 He disappears into Olhausen's, the porkbutcher's, under the downcoming
20027 rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter,
20028 puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one
20029 containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter,
20030 sprinkled with wholepepper. He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to
20031 one side he presses a parcel against his ribs and groans.)_
20032 
20033 BLOOM: Stitch in my side. Why did I run?
20034 
20035 He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset
20036 siding. The glow leaps again.)_
20037 
20038 BLOOM: What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.
20039 
20040 He stands at Cormack's corner, watching)_
20041 
20042 BLOOM: _Aurora borealis_ or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course.
20043 South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're
20044 safe. _(He hums cheerfully)_ London's burning, London's burning! On
20045 fire, on fire! (_He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the
20046 crowd at the farther side of Talbot street_) I'll miss him. Run. Quick.
20047 Better cross here.
20048 
20049 He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)_
20050 
20051 THE URCHINS: Mind out, mister! (_Two cyclists, with lighted paper
20052 lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling_)
20053 
20054 THE BELLS: Haltyaltyaltyall.
20055 
20056 BLOOM: _(Halts erect, stung by a spasm)_ Ow!
20057 
20058 He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon
20059 sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him,
20060 its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The
20061 motorman bangs his footgong.)_
20062 
20063 THE GONG: Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.
20064 
20065 The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved
20066 hand, blunders stifflegged out of the track. The motorman, thrown
20067 forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over
20068 chains and keys.)_
20069 
20070 THE MOTORMAN: Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hat trick?
20071 
20072 BLOOM: _(Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a
20073 mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.)_ No thoroughfare. Close
20074 shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again.
20075 On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential.
20076 He feels his trouser pocket)_ Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch
20077 in track or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled
20078 off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick.
20079 Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous.
20080 Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same
20081 style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word
20082 spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I
20083 ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. _(He
20084 closes his eyes an instant)_ Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of
20085 the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!
20086 
20087 A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against o'beirne's wall, a
20088 visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved
20089 sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)
20090 
20091 BLOOM: _Buenas noches, seqorita Blanca, que calle es esta?_
20092 
20093 THE FIGURE: (_Impassive, raises a signal arm_) Password. _Sraid Mabbot._
20094 
20095 BLOOM: Haha. _Merci._ Esperanto. _Slan leath. (He mutters)_ Gaelic
20096 league spy, sent by that fireeater.
20097 
20098 He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps
20099 left, ragsackman left.)_
20100 
20101 BLOOM: I beg. (_He swerves, sidles, stepaside, slips past and on_.)
20102 
20103 BLOOM: Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a signpost planted
20104 by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who
20105 lost my way and contributed to the columns of the _Irish Cyclist_ the
20106 letter headed _In darkest Stepaside_. Keep, keep, keep to the right.
20107 Rags and bones at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer
20108 makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.
20109 
20110 Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against
20111 Bloom.)_
20112 
20113 BLOOM: O
20114 
20115 Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there.
20116 Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepoket,
20117 sweets of sin, potato soap.)_
20118 
20119 BLOOM: Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch
20120 your purse.
20121 
20122 The retriever approaches sniffing, nose to the ground. A sprawled form
20123 sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan
20124 of an elder in Zion and a smokingcap with magenta tassels. Horned
20125 spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are
20126 on the drawn face.)_
20127 
20128 RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with
20129 drunken goy ever. So you catch no money.
20130 
20131 BLOOM: _(Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen,
20132 feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi._
20133 
20134 RUDOLPH: What you making down this place? Have you no soul? _(with
20135 feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom)_ Are you not
20136 my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold
20137 who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham
20138 and Jacob?
20139 
20140 BLOOM: _(With precaution)_ I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's
20141 left of him.
20142 
20143 RUDOLPH: _(Severely)_ One night they bring you home drunk as dog after
20144 spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
20145 
20146 BLOOM: _(In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips,
20147 narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver
20148 waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one
20149 side of him coated with stiffening mud)_ Harriers, father. Only that
20150 once.
20151 
20152 RUDOLPH: Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make
20153 you kaputt, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
20154 
20155 BLOOM: _(Weakly)_ They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I
20156 slipped.
20157 
20158 RUDOLPH: _(With contempt) Goim nachez_! Nice spectacles for your poor
20159 mother!
20160 
20161 BLOOM: Mamma!
20162 
20163 ELLEN BLOOM: _(In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, widow Twankey's
20164 crinoline and bustle, blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind,
20165 grey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net,
20166 appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand,
20167 and cries out in shrill alarm)_ O blessed Redeemer, what have they done
20168 to him! My smelling salts! _(She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks
20169 the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a
20170 shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out)_ Sacred Heart of Mary,
20171 where were you at all at all?
20172 
20173 Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in
20174 his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)_
20175 
20176 A VOICE: _(Sharply)_ Poldy!
20177 
20178 BLOOM: Who? _(He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily)_ At your service.
20179 
20180 He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in
20181 Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet
20182 trousers and jacket, slashed with gold. A wide yellow cummerbund girdles
20183 her. A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free
20184 only her large dark eyes and raven hair.)_
20185 
20186 BLOOM: Molly!
20187 
20188 MARION: Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to
20189 me. _(Satirically)_ Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
20190 
20191 BLOOM: _(Shifts from foot to foot)_ No, no. Not the least little bit.
20192 
20193 He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions,
20194 hopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire,
20195 spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled
20196 toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her
20197 a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of
20198 innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with
20199 disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb
20200 wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)_
20201 
20202 MARION: Nebrakada! Femininum!
20203 
20204 The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit,
20205 offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops his
20206 head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops
20207 his back for leapfrog.)_
20208 
20209 BLOOM: I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer... Mrs
20210 Marion... if you...
20211 
20212 MARION: So you notice some change? _(Her hands passing slowly over her
20213 trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes)_ O Poldy,
20214 Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the
20215 wide world.
20216 
20217 BLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower
20218 water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the
20219 morning. _(He pats divers pockets)_ This moving kidney. Ah!
20220 
20221 He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon
20222 soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)_
20223 
20224 THE SOAP: We're a capital couple are Bloom and I. He brightens the
20225 earth. I polish the sky.
20226 
20227 
20228 The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the
20229 soapsun.)_
20230 
20231 SWENY: Three and a penny, please.
20232 
20233 BLOOM: Yes. For my wife. Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
20234 
20235 MARION: _(Softly)_ Poldy!
20236 
20237 BLOOM: Yes, ma'am?
20238 
20239 MARION: _ti trema un poco il cuore?_
20240 
20241 In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon,
20242 humming the duet from_ Don Giovanni.)
20243 
20244 BLOOM: Are you sure about that _voglio_? I mean the pronunciati...
20245 
20246 He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes
20247 his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)_
20248 
20249 THE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched.
20250 Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.
20251 
20252 She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled, Bridie
20253 Kelly stands.)_
20254 
20255 BRIDIE: Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
20256 
20257 With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues
20258 with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into
20259 gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)_
20260 
20261 THE BAWD: _(Her wolfeyes shining)_ He's getting his pleasure. You won't
20262 get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night
20263 before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
20264 
20265 Leering, Gerty Macdowell limps forward. She draws from behind, ogling,
20266 and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)_
20267 
20268 GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. _(She murmurs)_ You
20269 did that. I hate you.
20270 
20271 BLOOM: I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.
20272 
20273 THE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman
20274 false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take
20275 the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
20276 
20277 GERTY: _(To Bloom)_ When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.
20278 She paws his sleeve, slobbering)_ Dirty married man! I love you for
20279 doing that to me.
20280 
20281 She glides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat
20282 with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes
20283 wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)_
20284 
20285 MRS BREEN: Mr...
20286 
20287 BLOOM: _(Coughs gravely)_ Madam, when we last had this pleasure by
20288 letter dated the sixteenth instant...
20289 
20290 MRS BREEN: Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you
20291 nicely! Scamp!
20292 
20293 BLOOM: _(Hurriedly)_ Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think of me?
20294 Don't give me away. Walls have ears. How do you do? It's ages since I.
20295 You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having
20296 this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting
20297 quarter. Rescue of fallen women. Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...
20298 
20299 MRS BREEN: _(Holds up a finger)_ Now, don't tell a big fib! I know
20300 somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! _(Slily)_
20301 Account for yourself this very sminute or woe betide you!
20302 
20303 BLOOM: _(Looks behind)_ She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming.
20304 The exotic, you see. Negro servants in livery too if she had money.
20305 Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at
20306 the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
20307 
20308 Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks,
20309 upstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes,
20310 leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands
20311 jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they
20312 rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to
20313 back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)_
20314 
20315 TOM AND SAM:
20316 
20317      There's someone in the house with Dina
20318      There's someone in the house, I know,
20319      There's someone in the house with Dina
20320      Playing on the old banjo.
20321 
20322 They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling,
20323 chortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)_
20324 
20325 BLOOM: _(With a sour tenderish smile)_ A little frivol, shall we, if
20326 you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a
20327 fraction of a second?
20328 
20329 MRS BREEN: _(Screams gaily)_ O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
20330 
20331 BLOOM: For old sake' sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage
20332 mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft
20333 corner for you. _(Gloomily)_ 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear
20334 gazelle.
20335 
20336 MRS BREEN: Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. _(She
20337 puts out her hand inquisitively)_ What are you hiding behind your back?
20338 Tell us, there's a dear.
20339 
20340 BLOOM: _(Seizes her wrist with his free hand)_ Josie Powell that was,
20341 prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking
20342 back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina
20343 Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game,
20344 finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this
20345 snuffbox?
20346 
20347 MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic
20348 recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the
20349 ladies.
20350 
20351 BLOOM: _(Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings,
20352 blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl
20353 studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand)_ Ladies and
20354 gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
20355 
20356 MRS BREEN: The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.
20357 
20358 BLOOM: _(Meaningfully dropping his voice)_ I confess I'm teapot with
20359 curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot
20360 at present.
20361 
20362 MRS BREEN: _(Gushingly)_ Tremendously teapot! London's teapot and I'm
20363 simply teapot all over me! _(She rubs sides with him)_ After the parlour
20364 mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase
20365 ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
20366 
20367 BLOOM: _(Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his
20368 fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which
20369 she surrenders gently)_ The witching hour of night. I took the splinter
20370 out of this hand, carefully, slowly. _(Tenderly, as he slips on her
20371 finger a ruby ring) L` ci darem la mano._
20372 
20373 MRS BREEN: _(In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a
20374 tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside
20375 her moonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly)
20376 Voglio e non._ You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the
20377 heart.
20378 
20379 BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and
20380 the beast. I can never forgive you for that. _(His clenched fist at
20381 his brow)_ Think what it means. All you meant to me then. _(Hoarsely)_
20382 Woman, it's breaking me!
20383 
20384 Denis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich-boards,
20385 shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out,
20386 muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of
20387 the ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)_
20388 
20389 ALF BERGAN: _(Points jeering at the sandwichboards)_ U. p: Up.
20390 
20391 MRS BREEN: _(To Bloom)_ High jinks below stairs. _(She gives him the
20392 glad eye)_ Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.
20393 
20394 BLOOM: _(Shocked)_ Molly's best friend! Could you?
20395 
20396 MRS BREEN: _(Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss)_
20397 Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
20398 
20399 BLOOM: _(Offhandedly)_ Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without
20400 potted meat is incomplete. I was at _Leah._ Mrs Bandmann Palmer.
20401 Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the
20402 programme. Rattling good place round there for pigs' feet. Feel.
20403 
20404 Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears
20405 weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which
20406 a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He opens it
20407 and shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and
20408 tightpacked pills.)_
20409 
20410 RICHIE: Best value in Dub.
20411 
20412 Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his
20413 napkin, waiting to wait.)_
20414 
20415 PAT: _(Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy)_ Steak and
20416 kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
20417 
20418 RICHIE: Goodgod. Inev erate inall...
20419 
20420 With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by,
20421 gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)_
20422 
20423 RICHIE: _(With a cry of pain, his hand to his back)_ Ah! Bright's!
20424 Lights!
20425 
20426 BLOOM: _(Ooints to the navvy)_ A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate
20427 stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
20428 
20429 MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and
20430 bull story.
20431 
20432 BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.
20433 But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular
20434 reason.
20435 
20436 MRS BREEN: _(All agog)_ O, not for worlds.
20437 
20438 BLOOM: Let's walk on. Shall us?
20439 
20440 MRS BREEN: Let's.
20441 
20442 The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The
20443 terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)_
20444 
20445 THE BAWD: Jewman's melt!
20446 
20447 BLOOM: _(In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,
20448 tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white
20449 spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in
20450 bandolier and a grey billycock hat)_ Do you remember a long long time,
20451 years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was
20452 weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
20453 
20454 MRS BREEN: _(In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider
20455 veil)_ Leopardstown.
20456 
20457 BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three
20458 year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old
20459 fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and
20460 you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that
20461 Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and
20462 eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what
20463 you like she did it on purpose...
20464 
20465 MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!
20466 
20467 BLOOM: Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky
20468 little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired
20469 on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a
20470 pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with
20471 a heart the size of a fullstop.
20472 
20473 MRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers)_ Naughty cruel I was!
20474 
20475 BLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly)_ And Molly was eating a
20476 sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly,
20477 though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her
20478 style. She was...
20479 
20480 MRS BREEN: Too...
20481 
20482 BLOOM: Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly
20483 were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses,
20484 the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses
20485 was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I
20486 ever heard or read or knew or came across...
20487 
20488 MRS BREEN: _(Eagerly)_ Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
20489 
20490 She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on
20491 towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her
20492 feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers
20493 listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with raucous
20494 humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed
20495 sodden playfight.)_
20496 
20497 THE GAFFER: _(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout)_ And when Cairns
20498 came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he after doing
20499 it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the
20500 shavings for Derwan's plasterers.
20501 
20502 THE LOITERERS: _(Guffaw with cleft palates)_ O jays!
20503 
20504 Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their
20505 lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)_
20506 
20507 BLOOM: Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad
20508 daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.
20509 
20510 THE LOITERERS: Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the
20511 men's porter.
20512 
20513 Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled,
20514 call from lanes, doors, corners.)_
20515 
20516 THE WHORES:
20517 
20518      Are you going far, queer fellow?
20519      How's your middle leg?
20520      Got a match on you?
20521      Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.
20522 
20523 
20524 He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From
20525 a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk.
20526 In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two
20527 redcoats.)_
20528 
20529 THE NAVVY: _(Belching)_ Where's the bloody house?
20530 
20531 THE SHEBEENKEEPER: Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout.
20532 Respectable woman.
20533 
20534 THE NAVVY: _(Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them)_
20535 Come on, you British army!
20536 
20537 PRIVATE CARR: _(Behind his back)_ He aint half balmy.
20538 
20539 PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Laughs)_ What ho!
20540 
20541 PRIVATE CARR: _(To the navvy)_ Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for
20542 Carr. Just Carr.
20543 
20544 THE NAVVY: _(Shouts)_
20545 
20546 We are the boys. Of Wexford.
20547 
20548 PRIVATE COMPTON: Say! What price the sergeantmajor?
20549 
20550 PRIVATE CARR: Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.
20551 
20552 THE NAVVY: _(Shouts)_
20553 
20554      The galling chain.
20555      And free our native land.
20556 
20557 He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault.
20558 The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting)_
20559 
20560 BLOOM: Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they
20561 are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at
20562 Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far.
20563 Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding
20564 for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What
20565 am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't
20566 heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have
20567 met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for
20568 cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have
20569 lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only
20570 for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed
20571 Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot.
20572 Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages
20573 for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff.
20574 God help his gamekeeper.
20575 
20576 He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend_ Wet Dream
20577 and a phallic design._) Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane
20578 at Kingstown. What's that like? _(Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted
20579 doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The
20580 odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling
20581 wreaths.)_
20582 
20583 THE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.
20584 
20585 BLOOM: My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get
20586 all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too
20587 much. _(The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand,
20588 wagging his tail.)_ Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today.
20589 Better speak to him first. Like women they like _rencontres._ Stinks
20590 like a polecat. _Chacun son gout_. He might be mad. Dogdays. Uncertain
20591 in his movements. Good fellow! Fido! Good fellow! Garryowen! _(The
20592 wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his
20593 long black tongue lolling out.)_ Influence of his surroundings. Give
20594 and have done with it. Provided nobody. _(Calling encouraging words he
20595 shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into
20596 a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the
20597 crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.)_ Sizeable for
20598 threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort.
20599 Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.
20600 
20601 With regret he lets the unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The
20602 mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed,
20603 crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant.
20604 They murmur together.)_
20605 
20606 THE WATCH: Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.
20607 
20608 Each lays hand on Bloom's shoulder.)_
20609 
20610 FIRST WATCH: Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.
20611 
20612 BLOOM: _(Stammers)_ I am doing good to others.
20613 
20614 A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with
20615 Banbury cakes in their beaks.)_
20616 
20617 THE GULLS: Kaw kave kankury kake.
20618 
20619 BLOOM: The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

20621 He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high barstool, sways over the
20622 munching spaniel.)_
20623 
20624 BOB DORAN: Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.
20625 
20626 The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig's knuckle
20627 between his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran
20628 fills silently into an area.)_
20629 
20630 SECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals.
20631 
20632 BLOOM: _(Enthusiastically)_ A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on
20633 Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab.
20634 Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last
20635 tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
20636 
20637 Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs
20638 in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paperhoop, a
20639 curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging
20640 boarhound.)_
20641 
20642 SIGNOR MAFFEI: _(With a sinister smile)_ Ladies and gentlemen, my
20643 educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my
20644 patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted
20645 thong. Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your lion to
20646 heel, no matter how fractious, even _Leo ferox_ there, the Libyan
20647 maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part
20648 produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. _(He glares)_ I possess
20649 the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers.
20650 With a bewitching smile)_ I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride
20651 of the ring.
20652 
20653 FIRST WATCH: Come. Name and address.
20654 
20655 BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! _(He takes off his high
20656 grade hat, saluting)_ Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard
20657 of von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. _Donnerwetter!_ Owns half Austria.
20658 Egypt. Cousin.
20659 
20660 FIRST WATCH: Proof.
20661 
20662 A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)_
20663 
20664 BLOOM: _(In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing
20665 a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and
20666 offers it)_ Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors:
20667 Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.
20668 
20669 FIRST WATCH: _(Reads)_ Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Unlawfully watching
20670 and besetting.
20671 
20672 SECOND WATCH: An alibi. You are cautioned.
20673 
20674 BLOOM: _(Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower)_ This
20675 is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his
20676 name. _(Plausibly)_ You know that old joke, rose of Castile. Bloom. The
20677 change of name. Virag. _(He murmurs privately and confidentially)_ We
20678 are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. _(He
20679 shoulders the second watch gently)_ Dash it all. It's a way we gallants
20680 have in the navy. Uniform that does it. _(He turns gravely to the first
20681 watch)_ Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in
20682 some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. _(To the second watch
20683 gaily)_ I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in the shake of
20684 a lamb's tail.
20685 
20686 A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)_
20687 
20688 THE DARK MERCURY: The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of
20689 the army.
20690 
20691 MARTHA: _(Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of
20692 the_ Irish Times _in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing)_ Henry!
20693 Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.
20694 
20695 FIRST WATCH: _(Sternly)_ Come to the station.
20696 
20697 BLOOM: _(Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart
20698 and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and
20699 dueguard of fellowcraft)_ No, no, worshipful master, light of love.
20700 Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember
20701 the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with
20702 a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than
20703 ninetynine wrongfully condemned.
20704 
20705 MARTHA: _(Sobbing behind her veil)_ Breach of promise. My real name
20706 is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my
20707 brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.
20708 
20709 BLOOM: _(Behind his hand)_ She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. _(He
20710 murmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim)_ Shitbroleeth.
20711 
20712 SECOND WATCH: _(Tears in his eyes, to Bloom)_ You ought to be thoroughly
20713 well ashamed of yourself.
20714 
20715 BLOOM: Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am
20716 a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable
20717 married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.
20718 My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant
20719 upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy,
20720 one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his
20721 majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.
20722 
20723 FIRST WATCH: Regiment.
20724 
20725 BLOOM: _(Turns to the gallery)_ The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the
20726 earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms
20727 up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police,
20728 guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men,
20729 as physique, in the service of our sovereign.
20730 
20731 A VOICE: Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?
20732 
20733 BLOOM: _(His hand on the shoulder of the first watch)_ My old dad too
20734 was a J. P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with
20735 the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general
20736 Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was
20737 mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. _(With quiet
20738 feeling)_ Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.
20739 
20740 FIRST WATCH: Profession or trade.
20741 
20742 BLOOM: Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. In fact
20743 we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the
20744 inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected
20745 with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...
20746 
20747 Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His
20748 scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles
20749 a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a
20750 telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)_
20751 
20752 MYLES CRAWFORD: _(His cock's wattles wagging)_ Hello, seventyseven
20753 eightfour. Hello. _Freeman's Urinal_ and _Weekly Arsewipe_ here.
20754 Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?
20755 
20756 Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate
20757 morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing,
20758 creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He carries a large portfolio
20759 labelled_ Matcham's Masterstrokes.)
20760 
20761 BEAUFOY: _(Drawls)_ No, you aren't. Not by a long shot if I know it.
20762 I don't see it that's all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most
20763 rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly
20764 loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak
20765 masquerading as a litterateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most
20766 inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really
20767 gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath
20768 suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which
20769 your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the
20770 kingdom.
20771 
20772 BLOOM: _(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum)_ That bit about the
20773 laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...
20774 
20775 BEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court)_ You
20776 funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't
20777 think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.
20778 My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my
20779 lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are
20780 considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw
20781 of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.
20782 
20783 BLOOM: _(Indistinctly)_ University of life. Bad art.
20784 
20785 BEAUFOY: _(Shouts)_ It's a damnably foul lie, showing the moral
20786 rottenness of the man! _(He extends his portfolio)_ We have here damning
20787 evidence, the _corpus delicti_, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work
20788 disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.
20789 
20790 A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:
20791 
20792 Moses, Moses, king of the jews, Wiped his arse in the Daily News.
20793 
20794 BLOOM: _(Bravely)_ Overdrawn.
20795 
20796 BEAUFOY: You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you
20797 rotter! _(To the court)_ Why, look at the man's private life! Leading
20798 a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be
20799 mentioned in mixed society! The archconspirator of the age!
20800 
20801 BLOOM: _(To the court)_ And he, a bachelor, how...
20802 
20803 FIRST WATCH: The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.
20804 
20805 THE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!
20806 
20807 Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket
20808 on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)_
20809 
20810 SECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?
20811 
20812 MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly)_ I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable
20813 character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation,
20814 six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave
20815 owing to his carryings on.
20816 
20817 FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?
20818 
20819 MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself
20820 as poor as I am.
20821 
20822 BLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless
20823 slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly)_ I treated you white.
20824 I gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.
20825 Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.
20826 There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.
20827 
20828 MARY DRISCOLL: _(Excitedly)_ As God is looking down on me this night if
20829 ever I laid a hand to them oysters!
20830 
20831 FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?
20832 
20833 MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour,
20834 when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety
20835 pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he
20836 interfered twict with my clothing.
20837 
20838 BLOOM: She counterassaulted.
20839 
20840 MARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully)_ I had more respect for the scouringbrush,
20841 so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: keep it
20842 quiet.
20843 
20844 General laughter.)_
20845 
20846 GEORGE FOTTRELL: _(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly)_ Order in
20847 court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.
20848 
20849 Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins
20850 a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in
20851 his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but, though
20852 branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to
20853 retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to
20854 nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths' child, he had been
20855 carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There
20856 might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over
20857 a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post,
20858 to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the
20859 affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An
20860 acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate
20861 of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain
20862 refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of
20863 loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly
20864 rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one
20865 and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to
20866 the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or
20867 model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour
20868 reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the
20869 boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what
20870 times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with
20871 four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain
20872 ever..._
20873 
20874 Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that
20875 they cannot hear.)_
20876 
20877 LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND: _(Without looking up from their notebooks)_
20878 Loosen his boots.
20879 
20880 PROFESSOR MACHUGH: _(From the presstable, coughs and calls)_ Cough it
20881 up, man. Get it out in bits.
20882 
20883 The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A large bucket.
20884 Bloom himself. Bowel trouble. In Beaver street Gripe, yes. Quite bad.
20885 A plasterer's bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery.
20886 Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial
20887 moment. He did not look in the bucket Nobody. Rather a mess. Not
20888 completely._ A Titbits _back number_.)
20889 
20890 Uproar and catcalls. Bloom in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash,
20891 dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of stickingplaster across
20892 his nose, talks inaudibly.)_
20893 
20894 J. J. O'MOLLOY: _(In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with
20895 a voice of pained protest)_ This is no place for indecent levity at
20896 the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a
20897 beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My
20898 client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as
20899 a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up
20900 misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on
20901 by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence
20902 being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the
20903 Pharaoh. _Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at
20904 carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of
20905 by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would
20906 deal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and
20907 somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could
20908 a tale unfold--one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between
20909 the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from
20910 cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian
20911 extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.
20912 
20913 BLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers,
20914 apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about
20915 him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches
20916 his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes
20917 the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.)_ Him makee velly muchee fine
20918 night. _(He begins to lilt simply)_
20919 
20920      Li li poo lil chile
20921      Blingee pigfoot evly night
20922      Payee two shilly...
20923 
20924 He is howled down.)_
20925 
20926 J. J. O'MOLLOY: _(Hotly to the populace)_ This is a lonehand fight. By
20927 Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this
20928 fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has
20929 superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically,
20930 without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused
20931 was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered
20932 with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very
20933 own daughter. _(Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his
20934 lips.)_ I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the
20935 hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My
20936 client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to
20937 do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or
20938 cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard,
20939 responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He
20940 wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down
20941 on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property
20942 at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be
20943 shown. _(To Bloom)_ I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.
20944 
20945 BLOOM: A penny in the pound.
20946 
20947 The image of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in
20948 silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino,
20949 in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an
20950 orange citron and a pork kidney.)_
20951 
20952 DLUGACZ: _(Hoarsely)_ Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W.13.
20953 
20954 J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his
20955 coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with
20956 sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F.
20957 Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the
20958 galloping tide of rosepink blood.)_
20959 
20960 J.J.O'MOLLOY: _(Almost voicelessly)_ Excuse me. I am suffering from a
20961 severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words.
20962 He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of
20963 Seymour Bushe.)_ When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught
20964 that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of
20965 soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar
20966 the sacred benefit of the doubt. _(A paper with something written on it
20967 is handed into court._)
20968 
20969 BLOOM: _(In court dress)_ Can give best references. Messrs Callan,
20970 Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon,
20971 ex lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the
20972 highest... Queens of Dublin society. _(Carelessly)_ I was just chatting
20973 this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and
20974 lady Ball, astronomer royal at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...
20975 
20976 MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength
20977 ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of
20978 brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair)_ Arrest him, constable. He
20979 wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was
20980 in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James
20981 Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as
20982 I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command performance of _La
20983 Cigale_. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures
20984 to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following
20985 Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work
20986 of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl with the Three
20987 Pairs of Stays_.
20988 
20989 MRS BELLINGHAM: _(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the
20990 nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell
20991 quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff)_
20992 Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because
20993 he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day
20994 during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the
20995 wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently
20996 he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said,
20997 in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the
20998 information that it was ablossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined
20999 from a forcingcase of the model farm.
21000 
21001 MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!
21002 
21003 A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward)_
21004 
21005 THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: _(Screaming)_ Stop thief! Hurrah there,
21006 Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!
21007 
21008 SECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs)_ Here are the darbies.
21009 
21010 MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome
21011 compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my
21012 frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself
21013 as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate
21014 proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery
21015 and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable,
21016 a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether
21017 extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and
21018 eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which,
21019 he said, he could conjure up. He urged me (stating that he felt it
21020 his mission in life to urge me) to defile the marriage bed, to commit
21021 adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.
21022 
21023 THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,
21024 jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets
21025 with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she
21026 strikes her welt constantly)_ Also me. Because he saw me on the polo
21027 ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of
21028 Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger
21029 Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob
21030 Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car
21031 and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold
21032 after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still.
21033 It represents a partially nude seqorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as
21034 he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit
21035 intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me
21036 to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He
21037 implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise
21038 him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most
21039 vicious horsewhipping.
21040 
21041 MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.
21042 
21043 MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.

21045 Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters
21046 received from Bloom.)_
21047 
21048 THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Stamps her jingling spurs in a
21049 sudden paroxysm of fury)_ I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the
21050 pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.
21051 
21052 BLOOM: _(His eyes closing, quails expectantly)_ Here? _(He squirms)_
21053 Again! _(He pants cringing)_ I love the danger.
21054 
21055 THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I'll make it hot for
21056 you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.
21057 
21058 MRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and
21059 stripes on it!
21060 
21061 MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married
21062 man!
21063 
21064 BLOOM: All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling
21065 glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.
21066 
21067 THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively)_ O, did you, my
21068 fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your
21069 life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained
21070 for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.
21071 
21072 MRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively)_
21073 Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within
21074 an inch of his life. The cat-o'-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.
21075 
21076 BLOOM: _(Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien)_ O
21077 cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet.
21078 Let me off this once. _(He offers the other cheek)_
21079 
21080 MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(Severely)_ Don't do so on any account, Mrs
21081 Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!
21082 
21083 THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet
21084 violently)_ I'll do no such thing. Pigdog and always was ever since
21085 he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in
21086 the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a
21087 wellknown cuckold. _(She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air)_
21088 Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick!
21089 Ready?
21090 
21091 BLOOM: _(Trembling, beginning to obey)_ The weather has been so warm.

21099 The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and
21100 exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend
21101 John Hughes S.J. bend low.)_
21102 
21103 THE TIMEPIECE: _(Unportalling)_
21104 
21105      Cuckoo.
21106      Cuckoo.
21107      Cuckoo.
21108 
21109 The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)_
21110 
21111 THE QUOITS: Jigjag. Jigajiga. Jigjag.
21112 
21113 A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox
21114 the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman, silkhatted, Jack Power, Simon
21115 Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton Myles Crawford,
21116 Lenehan, Paddy Leonard, Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a
21117 Nameless One.)_
21118 
21119 THE NAMELESS ONE: Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised
21120 her.
21121 
21122 THE JURORS: _(All their heads turned to his voice)_ Really?
21123 
21124 THE NAMELESS ONE: _(Snarls)_ Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.
21125 
21126 THE JURORS: _(All their heads lowered in assent)_ Most of us thought as
21127 much.
21128 
21129 FIRST WATCH: He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack
21130 the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.
21131 
21132 SECOND WATCH: _(Awed, whispers)_ And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.
21133 
21134 THE CRIER: _(Loudly)_ Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a
21135 wellknown dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold and a public
21136 nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of
21137 assizes the most honourable...
21138 
21139 His Honour, sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, in judicial
21140 garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his
21141 arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic
21142 ramshorns.)_
21143 
21144 THE RECORDER: I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid
21145 Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! _(He dons the black cap)_ Let
21146 him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and
21147 detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure
21148 and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not
21149 at your peril or may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Remove him. _(A
21150 black skullcap descends upon his head.)_
21151 
21152 The subsheriff Long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry
21153 Clay.)_
21154 
21155 LONG JOHN FANNING: _(Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance)_
21156 Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?
21157 
21158 H. Rumbold, master barber, in a bloodcoloured jerkin and tanner's
21159 apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder, mounts the block. A life
21160 preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs
21161 grimly his grappling hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)_
21162 
21163 RUMBOLD: _(To the recorder with sinister familiarity)_ Hanging Harry,
21164 your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or
21165 nothing.
21166 
21167 The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)_
21168 
21169 THE BELLS: Heigho! Heigho!
21170 
21171 BLOOM: _(Desperately)_ Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence.
21172 Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzee. _(Breathlessly)_ Pelvic
21173 basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. _(Overcome with emotion)_ I left
21174 the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing) Hynes, may
21175 I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you
21176 want a little more...
21177 
21178 HYNES: _(Coldly)_ You are a perfect stranger.
21179 
21180 SECOND WATCH: _(Points to the corner)_ The bomb is here.
21181 
21182 FIRST WATCH: Infernal machine with a time fuse.
21183 
21184 BLOOM: No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral.
21185 
21186 FIRST WATCH: _(Draws his truncheon)_ Liar!
21187 
21188 The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy
21189 Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath.
21190 He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown
21191 mortuary habit. His green eye flashes bloodshot. Half of one ear, all
21192 the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)_
21193 
21194 PADDY DIGNAM: _(In a hollow voice)_ It is true. It was my funeral.
21195 Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease
21196 from natural causes.
21197 
21198 He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)_
21199 
21200 BLOOM: _(In triumph)_ You hear?
21201 
21202 PADDY DIGNAM: Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!
21203 
21204 BLOOM: The voice is the voice of Esau.
21205 
21206 SECOND WATCH: _(Blesses himself)_ How is that possible?
21207 
21208 FIRST WATCH: It is not in the penny catechism.
21209 
21210 PADDY DIGNAM: By metempsychosis. Spooks.
21211 
21212 A VOICE: O rocks.
21213 
21214 PADDY DIGNAM: _(Earnestly)_ Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton,
21215 solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk.
21216 Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The
21217 poor wife was awfully cut up. How is she bearing it? Keep her off that
21218 bottle of sherry. _(He looks round him)_ A lamp. I must satisfy an
21219 animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.
21220 
21221 The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker, stands forth, holding
21222 a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey,
21223 chaplain, toadbellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap,
21224 holding sleepily a staff twisted poppies.)_
21225 
21226 FATHER COFFEY: _(Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak)_ Namine.
21227 Jacobs. Vobiscuits. Amen.
21228 
21229 JOHN O'CONNELL: _(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone)_ Dignam,
21230 Patrick T, deceased.
21231 
21232 PADDY DIGNAM: _(With pricked up ears, winces)_ Overtones. _(He wriggles
21233 forward and places an ear to the ground)_ My master's voice!
21234 
21235 JOHN O'CONNELL: Burial docket letter number U. P. eightyfive thousand.
21236 Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.
21237 
21238 Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tail
21239 stiffpointcd, his ears cocked.)_
21240 
21241 PADDY DIGNAM: Pray for the repose of his soul.
21242 
21243 He worms down through a coalhole, his brown habit trailing its tether
21244 over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on
21245 fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is
21246 heard baying under ground:_ Dignam's dead and gone below. _Tom Rochford,
21247 robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his twocolumned
21248 machine.)_
21249 
21250 TOM ROCHFORD: _(A hand to his breastbone, bows)_ Reuben J. A florin I
21251 find him. _(He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare)_ My turn now on.
21252 Follow me up to Carlow.
21253 
21254 He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the
21255 coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble, eyes of nought. All recedes.
21256 Bloom plodges forward again through the sump. Kisses chirp amid
21257 the rifts of fog a piano sounds. He stands before a lighted house,
21258 listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers fly about him,
21259 twittering, warbling, cooing.)_
21260 
21261 THE KISSES: _(Warbling)_ Leo! _(Twittering)_ Icky licky micky sticky for
21262 Leo! _(Cooing)_ Coo coocoo! Yummyyum, Womwom! _(Warbling)_ Big comebig!
21263 Pirouette! Leopopold! _(Twittering)_ Leeolee! _(Warbling)_ O Leo!
21264 
21265 They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddy flecks,
21266 silvery sequins.)_
21267 
21268 BLOOM: A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.
21269 
21270 Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three
21271 bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips
21272 down the steps and accosts him.)_
21273 
21274 ZOE: Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.
21275 
21276 BLOOM: Is this Mrs Mack's?
21277 
21278 ZOE: No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse.
21279 Mother Slipperslapper. _(Familiarly)_ She's on the job herself tonight
21280 with the vet her tipster that gives her all the winners and pays for
21281 her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today.
21282 Suspiciously)_ You're not his father, are you?
21283 
21284 BLOOM: Not I!
21285 
21286 ZOE: You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?
21287 
21288 His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand glides over his
21289 left thigh.)_
21290 
21291 ZOE: How's the nuts?
21292 
21293 BLOOM: Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier, I suppose.
21294 One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.
21295 
21296 ZOE: _(In sudden alarm)_ You've a hard chancre.
21297 
21298 BLOOM: Not likely.
21299 
21300 ZOE: I feel it.
21301 
21302 Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard
21303 black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist
21304 lips.)_
21305 
21306 BLOOM: A talisman. Heirloom.
21307 
21308 ZOE: For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?
21309 
21310 She puts the potato greedily into a pocket then links his arm,
21311 cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by
21312 note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her
21313 eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)_
21314 
21315 ZOE: You'll know me the next time.
21316 
21317 BLOOM: _(Forlornly)_ I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to...
21318 
21319 Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round
21320 their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong
21321 hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by
21322 the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity nude, white,
21323 still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth
21324 roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes,
21325 strangely murmuring.)_
21326 
21327 ZOE: _(Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously
21328 smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater) Schorach ani wenowach,
21329 benoith Hierushaloim._
21330 
21331 BLOOM: _(Fascinated)_ I thought you were of good stock by your accent.
21332 
21333 ZOE: And you know what thought did?
21334 
21335 She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth, sending on
21336 him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a
21337 sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)_
21338 
21339 BLOOM: _(Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat
21340 awkward hand)_ Are you a Dublin girl?
21341 
21342 ZOE: _(Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil)_ No bloody
21343 fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?
21344 
21345 BLOOM: _(As before)_ Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish
21346 device. _(Lewdly)_ The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder
21347 of rank weed.
21348 
21349 ZOE: Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.
21350 
21351 BLOOM: _(In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating
21352 tie and apache cap)_ Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Ralegh brought
21353 from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of
21354 pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart,
21355 memory, will understanding, all. That is to say he brought the poison
21356 a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the
21357 food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!
21358 
21359 Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)_
21360 
21361 THE CHIMES: Turn again, Leopold! Lord mayor of Dublin!
21362 
21363 BLOOM: _(In alderman's gown and chain)_ Electors of Arran Quay, Inns
21364 Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say,
21365 from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future.
21366 That's my programme. _Cui bono_? But our bucaneering Vanderdeckens in
21367 their phantom ship of finance...
21368 
21369 AN ELECTOR: Three times three for our future chief magistrate!
21370 
21371 The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)_
21372 
21373 THE TORCHBEARERS: Hooray!
21374 
21375 Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city
21376 shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late
21377 thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and
21378 white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens.
21379 They nod vigorously in agreement.)_
21380 
21381 LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON: _(In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral
21382 chain and large white silk scarf)_ That alderman sir Leo Bloom's speech
21383 be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which
21384 he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the
21385 thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth
21386 designated Boulevard Bloom.
21387 
21388 COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK: Carried unanimously.
21389 
21390 BLOOM: _(Impassionedly)_ These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as
21391 they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they?
21392 Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving
21393 apparatuses, supplanters, bugbears, manufactured monsters for mutual
21394 murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts
21395 upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are
21396 grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges
21397 in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for
21398 rever and ever and ev...
21399 
21400 Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring
21401 up. A streamer bearing the legends_ Cead Mile Failte _and_ Mah Ttob
21402 Melek Israel _Spans the street. All the windows are thronged with
21403 sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the
21404 royal Dublin Fusiliers, the King's own Scottish Borderers, the Cameron
21405 Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers standing to attention, keep back
21406 the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts,
21407 telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings,
21408 rainspouts, whistling and cheering the pillar of the cloud appears. A
21409 fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The
21410 beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and
21411 waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high,
21412 surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession
21413 appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard
21414 tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are
21415 followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of
21416 Dublin, his lordship the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the
21417 mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, twentyeight Irish
21418 representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth
21419 of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the
21420 saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop
21421 of Down and Connor, His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue, archbishop of
21422 Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William
21423 Alexander, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief
21424 rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist,
21425 methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society
21426 of friends. After them march the guilds and trades and trainbands
21427 with flying colours: coopers, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper
21428 canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers,
21429 chimneysweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers,
21430 Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers,
21431 undertakers, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters,
21432 assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers,
21433 fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository
21434 hands, bullion brokers, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers,
21435 egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After
21436 them march gentlemen of the bedchamber, Black Rod, Deputy Garter,
21437 Gold Stick, the master of horse, the lord great chamberlain, the earl
21438 marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's
21439 iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet.
21440 Beefeaters reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph
21441 Bloom appears, bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with
21442 ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove,
21443 the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite horse with long flowing crimson
21444 tail, richly caparisoned, with golden headstall. Wild excitement. The
21445 ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed
21446 with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with
21447 branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)_
21448 
21449 BLOOM'S BOYS:
21450 
21451      The wren, the wren,
21452      The king of all birds,
21453      Saint Stephen's his day
21454      Was caught in the furze.
21455 
21456 
21457 A BLACKSMITH: _(Murmurs)_ For the honour of God! And is that Bloom? He
21458 scarcely looks thirtyone.
21459 
21460 A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER: That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest
21461 reformer. Hats off!
21462 
21463 All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)_
21464 
21465 A MILLIONAIRESS: _(Richly)_ Isn't he simply wonderful?
21466 
21467 A NOBLEWOMAN: _(Nobly)_ All that man has seen!
21468 
21469 A FEMINIST: _(Masculinely)_ And done!
21470 
21471 A BELLHANGER: A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.
21472 
21473 Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)_
21474 
21475 THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR: I here present your undoubted
21476 emperor-president and king-chairman, the most serene and potent and very
21477 puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!
21478 
21479 ALL: God save Leopold the First!
21480 
21481 BLOOM: _(In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and
21482 Connor, with dignity)_ Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.
21483 
21484 WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: _(In purple stock and shovel hat)_
21485 Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your
21486 judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?
21487 
21488 BLOOM: _(Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears)_ So may the
21489 Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.
21490 
21491 MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: _(Pours a cruse of hairoil over Bloom's
21492 head) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem._ Leopold,
21493 Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!
21494 
21495 Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He
21496 ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put
21497 on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ
21498 church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar
21499 fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic
21500 designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and
21501 genuflecting.)_
21502 
21503 THE PEERS: I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly
21504 worship.
21505 
21506 Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor
21507 diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless
21508 intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception
21509 of message.)_
21510 
21511 BLOOM: My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix
21512 hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated
21513 our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess
21514 Selene, the splendour of night.
21515 
21516 The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black
21517 Maria. The princess Selene, in moonblue robes, a silver crescent on her
21518 head, descends from a Sedan chair, borne by two giants. An outburst of
21519 cheering.)_
21520 
21521 JOHN HOWARD PARNELL: _(Raises the royal standard)_ Illustrious Bloom!
21522 Successor to my famous brother!
21523 
21524 BLOOM: _(Embraces John Howard Parnell)_ We thank you from our heart,
21525 John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of
21526 our common ancestors.
21527 
21528 The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The
21529 keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows
21530 all that he is wearing green socks.)_
21531 
21532 TOM KERNAN: You deserve it, your honour.
21533 
21534 BLOOM: On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at
21535 Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with
21536 telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do
21537 we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the
21538 left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering
21539 their warcry _Bonafide Sabaoth_, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.
21540 
21541 THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS: Hear! Hear!
21542 
21543 JOHN WYSE NOLAN: There's the man that got away James Stephens.
21544 
21545 A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY: Bravo!
21546 
21547 AN OLD RESIDENT: You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you
21548 are.
21549 
21550 AN APPLEWOMAN: He's a man like Ireland wants.
21551 
21552 BLOOM: My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell
21553 you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall
21554 ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem
21555 in the Nova Hibernia of the future.
21556 
21557 Thirtytwo workmen, wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland,
21558 under the guidance of Derwan the builder, construct the new Bloomusalem.
21559 It is a colossal edifice with crystal roof, built in the shape of a
21560 huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its
21561 extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government
21562 offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses
21563 are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and
21564 boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. several paupers
21565 fill from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal
21566 sightseers, collapses.)_
21567 
21568 THE SIGHTSEERS: _(Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die)_
21569 
21570 A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trapdoor. He points an
21571 elongated finger at Bloom.)_
21572 
21573 THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH: Don't you believe a word he says. That man is
21574 Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.
21575 
21576 BLOOM: Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!
21577 
21578 A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his
21579 sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many
21580 powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing
21581 committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money,
21582 commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive
21583 Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives in
21584 sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock,_
21585 billets doux _in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers
21586 of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days'
21587 indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes,
21588 season tickets available for all tramlines, coupons of the royal and
21589 privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of
21590 the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy And Fritz (politic), Care of the
21591 Baby (infantilic), 50 Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?
21592 historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the

21595 Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way
21596 to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward
21597 to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The Lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts
21598 through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks
21599 amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken.
21600 Babes and sucklings are held up.)_
21601 
21602 THE WOMEN: Little father! Little father!
21603 
21604 THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS:
21605 
21606      Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
21607      Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.
21608 
21609 
21610 Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)_
21611 
21612 BABY BOARDMAN: _(Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth)_
21613 Hajajaja.
21614 
21615 BLOOM: _(Shaking hands with a blind stripling)_ My more than Brother!
21616 Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple)_ Dear old
21617 friends! _(He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls)_
21618 Peep! Bopeep! _(He wheels twins in a perambulator)_ Ticktacktwo
21619 wouldyousetashoe? _(He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange,
21620 yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his
21621 mouth)_ Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. _(He consoles a widow)_ Absence
21622 makes the heart grow younger. _(He dances the Highland fling with
21623 grotesque antics)_ Leg it, ye devils! _(He kisses the bedsores of a
21624 palsied veteran_) Honourable wounds! _(He trips up a fit policeman)_
21625 U. p: up. U. p: up. _(He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and
21626 laughs kindly)_ Ah, naughty, naughty! _(He eats a raw turnip offered
21627 him by Maurice Butterly, farmer)_ Fine! Splendid! _(He refuses to
21628 accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist)_ My dear
21629 fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar) Please accept. _(He
21630 takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples)_
21631 Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!
21632 
21633 THE CITIZEN: _(Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald
21634 muffler)_ May the good God bless him!
21635 
21636 The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)_
21637 
21638 BLOOM: _(Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and
21639 reads solemnly)_ Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom
21640 Kippur Hanukah Roschaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim
21641 Meshuggah Talith.
21642 
21643 An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town
21644 clerk.)_
21645 
21646 JIMMY HENRY: The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic
21647 Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal
21648 advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited.
21649 Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal
21650 Era.
21651 
21652 PADDY LEONARD: What am I to do about my rates and taxes?
21653 
21654 BLOOM: Pay them, my friend.
21655 
21656 PADDY LEONARD: Thank you.
21657 
21658 NOSEY FLYNN: Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?
21659 
21660 BLOOM: _(Obdurately)_ Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are
21661 bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five
21662 pounds.
21663 
21664 J. J. O'MOLLOY: A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!
21665 
21666 NOSEY FLYNN: Where do I draw the five pounds?
21667 
21668 PISSER BURKE: For bladder trouble?
21669 
21670 BLOOM:

21673      _Tinct. nux vom.,_ 5 minims

21675      _Aq. dis. ter in die._
21676 
21677 CHRIS CALLINAN: What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of
21678 Aldebaran?
21679 
21680 BLOOM: Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.
21681 
21682 JOE HYNES: Why aren't you in uniform?
21683 
21684 BLOOM: When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the
21685 Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?
21686 
21687 BEN DOLLARD: Pansies?
21688 
21689 BLOOM: Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.
21690 
21691 BEN DOLLARD: When twins arrive?
21692 
21693 BLOOM: Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.
21694 
21695 LARRY O'ROURKE: An eightday licence for my new premises. You remember
21696 me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen
21697 of stout for the missus.
21698 
21699 BLOOM: _(Coldly)_ You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no
21700 presents.
21701 
21702 CROFTON: This is indeed a festivity.
21703 
21704 BLOOM: _(Solemnly)_ You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.
21705 
21706 ALEXANDER KEYES: When will we have our own house of keys?
21707 
21708 BLOOM: I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten
21709 commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile.
21710 Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses.
21711 Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and
21712 night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy
21713 must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival with masked licence,
21714 bonuses for all, esperanto the universal language with universal
21715 brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors.
21716 Free money, free rent, free love and a free lay church in a free lay
21717 state.
21718 
21719 O'MADDEN BURKE: Free fox in a free henroost.
21720 
21721 DAVY BYRNE: _(Yawning)_ Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!
21722 
21723 BLOOM: Mixed races and mixed marriage.
21724 
21725 LENEHAN: What about mixed bathing?
21726 
21727 bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration.
21728 All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears,
21729 dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked
21730 goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos, Venus Metempsychosis, and
21731 plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce,
21732 Operatic Music, Amor, Publicity, Manufacture, Liberty of Speech, Plural
21733 Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments,
21734 Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)_
21735 
21736 FATHER FARLEY: He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an anythingarian
21737 seeking to overthrow our holy faith.
21738 
21739 MRS RIORDAN: _(Tears up her will)_ I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!
21740 
21741 MOTHER GROGAN: _(Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom)_ You beast! You
21742 abominable person!
21743 
21744 NOSEY FLYNN: Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.
21745 
21746 BLOOM: _(With rollicking humour)_
21747 
21748      I vowed that I never would leave her,
21749      She turned out a cruel deceiver.
21750      With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom.
21751 
21752 HOPPY HOLOHAN: Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.
21753 
21754 PADDY LEONARD: Stage Irishman!
21755 
21756 BLOOM: What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of
21757 Casteele._(Laughter.)_
21758 
21759 LENEHAN: Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!
21760 
21761 THE VEILED SIBYL: _(Enthusiastically)_ I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it.
21762 I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest
21763 man on earth.
21764 
21765 BLOOM: _(Winks at the bystanders)_ I bet she's a bonny lassie.
21766 
21767 THEODORE PUREFOY: _(In fishingcap and oilskin jacket)_ He employs a
21768 mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.
21769 
21770 THE VEILED SIBYL: _(Stabs herself)_ My hero god! _(She dies)_
21771 
21772 Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by
21773 stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening
21774 their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from
21775 the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery,
21776 asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gasovens, hanging
21777 themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different
21778 storeys.)_
21779 
21780 ALEXANDER J DOWIE: _(Violently)_ Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the
21781 man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian
21782 men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat
21783 of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the
21784 cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite,
21785 bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse.
21786 A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his
21787 nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him.
21788 Caliban!
21789 
21790 THE MOB: Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!
21791 
21792 Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper
21793 and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value,
21794 hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheep's
21795 tails, odd pieces of fat.)_
21796 
21797 BLOOM: _(Excitedly)_ This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again.
21798 By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry.
21799 He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the
21800 viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, _sgenl inn ban bata
21801 coisde gan capall._ I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex
21802 specialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf.
21803 
21804 DR MULLIGAN: _(In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow)_ Dr
21805 Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's
21806 private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary
21807 epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of
21808 elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are
21809 marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also
21810 latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in
21811 consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a
21812 family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him
21813 to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal
21814 examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,
21815 axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be _virgo intacta._
21816 
21817 Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)_
21818 
21819 DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming
21820 generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in
21821 spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.
21822 
21823 DR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid.
21824 Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.
21825 
21826 DR PUNCH COSTELLO: The _fetor judaicus_ is most perceptible.
21827 
21828 DR DIXON: _(Reads a bill of health)_ Professor Bloom is a finished
21829 example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable.
21830 Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint
21831 fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense.
21832 He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court
21833 missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up
21834 everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that
21835 he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried
21836 grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and
21837 summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one
21838 time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report
21839 states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the
21840 name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon
21841 to speak. He is about to have a baby.
21842 
21843 General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American
21844 makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, blank
21845 cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange,
21846 I. O. U's, wedding rings, watchchains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets
21847 are rapidly collected.)_
21848 
21849 BLOOM: O, I so want to be a mother.
21850 
21851 MRS THORNTON: _(In nursetender's gown)_ Embrace me tight, dear. You'll
21852 be soon over it. Tight, dear.
21853 
21854 Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white
21855 children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive
21856 plants. All the octuplets are handsome, with valuable metallic faces,
21857 wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern
21858 languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each
21859 has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro,
21860 Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindoree, Silversmile, Silberselber,
21861 Vifargent, Panargyros. They are immediately appointed to positions of
21862 high public trust in several different countries as managing directors
21863 of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability
21864 companies, vicechairmen of hotel syndicates.)_
21865 
21866 A VOICE: Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?
21867 
21868 BLOOM: _(Darkly)_ You have said it.
21869 
21870 BROTHER BUZZ: Then perform a miracle like Father Charles.
21871 
21872 BANTAM LYONS: Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.
21873 
21874 Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes
21875 through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the top ledge
21876 by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals
21877 several sufferers from king's evil, contracts his face so as to resemble
21878 many historical personages, Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Byron, Wat Tyler,
21879 Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip
21880 van Winkle, Kossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild,
21881 Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot
21882 simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back,
21883 eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)_

21902 A DEADHAND: _(Writes on the wall)_ Bloom is a cod.

21904 CRAB: _(In bushranger's kit)_ What did you do in the cattlecreep behind
21905 Kilbarrack?
21906 
21907 A FEMALE INFANT: _(Shakes a rattle)_ And under Ballybough bridge?
21908 
21909 A HOLLYBUSH: And in the devil's glen?
21910 
21911 BLOOM: _(Blushes furiously all over from frons to nates, three tears
21912 filling from his left eye)_ Spare my past.
21913 
21914 THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS: _(In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook
21915 fair shillelaghs)_ Sjambok him!
21916 
21917 Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms,
21918 his feet protruding. He whistles_ Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. _Artane
21919 orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate
21920 Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)_
21921 
21922 THE ARTANE ORPHANS:
21923 
21924      You hig, you hog, you dirty dog!
21925      You think the ladies love you!
21926      THE PRISON GATE GIRLS:
21927 
21928 
21929      If you see Kay
21930      Tell him he may
21931      See you in tea
21932      Tell him from me.
21933 
21934 HORNBLOWER: _(In ephod and huntingcap, announces)_ And he shall carry
21935 the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness,
21936 and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him,
21937 yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.
21938 
21939 All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide
21940 travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky
21941 and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their
21942 beards at Bloom.)_
21943 
21944 MASTIANSKY AND CITRON: Belial! Laemlein of Istria, the false Messiah!
21945 Abulafia! Recant!
21946 
21947 George R Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his
21948 arm, presenting a bill)_
21949 
21950 MESIAS: To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.
21951 
21952 BLOOM: _(Rubs his hands cheerfully)_ Just like old times. Poor Bloom!
21953 
21954 Reuben J Dodd, blackbearded iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his
21955 shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)_
21956 
21957 REUBEN J: _(Whispers hoarsely)_ The squeak is out. A split is gone for
21958 the flatties. Nip the first rattler.
21959 
21960 THE FIRE BRIGADE: Pflaap!
21961 
21962 BROTHER BUZZ: _(Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of
21963 painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round
21964 his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying)_ Forgive him his
21965 trespasses.
21966 
21967 Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets
21968 fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)_
21969 
21970 THE CITIZEN: Thank heaven!
21971 
21972 BLOOM: _(In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid
21973 phoenix flames)_ Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.
21974 
21975 He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of
21976 Erin, in black garments, with large prayerbooks and long lighted candles
21977 in their hands, kneel down and pray.)_
21978 
21979 THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN:
21980 
21981      Kidney of Bloom, pray for us

21993 
21994 A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Vincent O'brien, sings
21995 the chorus from Handel's Messiah alleluia for the lord god omnipotent
21996 reigneth, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute,
21997 shrunken, carbonised.)_
21998 
21999 
22000 ZOE: Talk away till you're black in the face.
22001 
22002 BLOOM: _(In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an
22003 emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak
22004 pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye)_ Let me be going now, woman of
22005 the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the
22006 father and mother of a bating. _(With a tear in his eye)_ All insanity.
22007 Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not
22008 to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. _(He
22009 gazes far away mournfully)_ I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The
22010 blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. _(He breathes softly)_ No
22011 more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.
22012 
22013 ZOE: _(Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet)_ Honest? Till the next
22014 time. _(She sneers)_ Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or
22015 came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts!
22016 
22017 BLOOM: _(Bitterly)_ Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.
22018 I'm sick of it. Let everything rip.
22019 
22020 ZOE: _(In sudden sulks)_ I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a
22021 bleeding whore a chance.
22022 
22023 BLOOM: _(Repentantly)_ I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil.
22024 Where are you from? London?
22025 
22026 ZOE: _(Glibly)_ Hog's Norton where the pigs plays the organs. I'm
22027 Yorkshire born. _(She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple)_
22028 I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a
22029 short time? Ten shillings?
22030 
22031 BLOOM: _(Smiles, nods slowly)_ More, houri, more.
22032 
22033 ZOE: And more's mother? _(She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws)_
22034 Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll
22035 peel off.
22036 
22037 BLOOM: _(Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled
22038 embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled
22039 pears)_ Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed
22040 monster. _(Earnestly)_ You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.
22041 
22042 ZOE: _(Flattered)_ What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for.
22043 She pats him)_ Come.
22044 
22045 BLOOM: Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.
22046 
22047 ZOE: Babby!
22048 
22049 BLOOM: _(In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair,
22050 fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a
22051 chubby finger, his moist tongue lolling and lisping)_ One two tlee: tlee
22052 tlwo tlone.
22053 
22054 THE BUCKLES: Love me. Love me not. Love me.
22055 
22056 ZOE: Silent means consent. _(With little parted talons she captures his
22057 hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the passtouch of secret monitor,
22058 luring him to doom.)_ Hot hands cold gizzard.
22059 
22060 He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards
22061 the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her
22062 painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the
22063 lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)_
22064 
22065 THE MALE BRUTES: _(Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their
22066 loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro)_
22067 Good!
22068 
22069 Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated.
22070 They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to
22071 his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)_
22072 
22073 ZOE: _(Her lucky hand instantly saving him)_ Hoopsa! Don't fall
22074 upstairs.
22075 
22076 BLOOM: The just man falls seven times. _(He stands aside at the
22077 threshold)_ After you is good manners.
22078 
22079 ZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after.
22080 
22081 She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out
22082 her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the antlered rack of the hall
22083 hang a man 's hat and waterproof. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing
22084 them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is
22085 flung open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes
22086 with an ape's gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a
22087 full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting
22088 his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel
22089 eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe
22090 into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the
22091 chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The
22092 floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar
22093 rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel,
22094 heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet
22095 without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls
22096 are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate
22097 is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on
22098 the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he
22099 beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume,
22100 doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in
22101 her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and
22102 glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag
22103 of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates
22104 mockingly the couple at the piano.)_
22105 
22106 KITTY: _(Coughs behind her hand)_ She's a bit imbecillic. _(She signs
22107 with a waggling forefinger)_ Blemblem. _(Lynch lifts up her skirt and
22108 white petticoat with his wand she settles them down quickly.)_ Respect
22109 yourself. _(She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which
22110 her hair glows, red with henna)_ O, excuse!
22111 
22112 ZOE: More limelight, Charley. _(She goes to the chandelier and turns the
22113 gas full cock)_
22114 
22115 KITTY: _(Peers at the gasjet)_ What ails it tonight?
22116 
22117 LYNCH: _(Deeply)_ Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.
22118 
22119 ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.
22120 
22121 The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at
22122 the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he
22123 repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond
22124 feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry,
22125 lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the
22126 bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)_
22127 
22128 KITTY: _(Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot)_ O, excuse!
22129 
22130 ZOE: _(Promptly)_ Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.
22131 
22132 Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over
22133 her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled
22134 caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances
22135 behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)_
22136 
22137 STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto
22138 Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an
22139 old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate _Coela enarrant gloriam Domini._
22140 It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and
22141 mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's
22142 that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip
22143 from the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of his
22144 almightiness. _Mais nom de nom,_ that is another pair of trousers.
22145 Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at
22146 Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs)_ Which side is your knowledge bump?
22147 
22148 THE CAP: _(With saturnine spleen)_ Bah! It is because it is. Woman's
22149 reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form
22150 of life. Bah!
22151 
22152 STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes.
22153 How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!
22154 
22155 THE CAP: Bah!
22156 
22157 STEPHEN: Here's another for you. _(He frowns)_ The reason is because
22158 the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible
22159 interval which...
22160 
22161 THE CAP: Which? Finish. You can't.
22162 
22163 STEPHEN: _(With an effort)_ Interval which. Is the greatest possible
22164 ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.
22165 
22166 THE CAP: Which?
22167 
22168 Outside the gramophone begins to blare_ The Holy City.)
22169 
22170 STEPHEN: _(Abruptly)_ What went forth to the ends of the world to
22171 traverse not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller,
22172 having itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a
22173 moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self
22174 which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. _Ecco!_
22175 
22176 LYNCH: _(With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe
22177 Higgins)_ What a learned speech, eh?
22178 
22179 ZOE: _(Briskly)_ God help your head, he knows more than you have
22180 forgotten.
22181 
22182 With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)_
22183 
22184 FLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer.
22185 
22186 KITTY: No!
22187 
22188 ZOE: _(Explodes in laughter)_ Great unjust God!
22189 
22190 FLORRY: _(Offended)_ Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist. O, my
22191 foot's tickling.
22192 
22193 Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patter past,
22194 yelling.)_
22195 
22196 THE NEWSBOYS: Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea
22197 serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.
22198 
22199 Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)_
22200 
22201 STEPHEN: A time, times and half a time.
22202 
22203 Reuben I Antichrist, wandering jew, a clutching hand open on his
22204 spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrim's wallet from
22205 which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his
22206 shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden
22207 huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from
22208 the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello,
22209 hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead
22210 and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering
22211 darkness.)_
22212 
22213 ALL: What?
22214 
22215 THE HOBGOBLIN: _(His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his
22216 eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping with outstretched clutching arms, then
22217 all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs) Il
22218 vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round
22219 and round with dervish howls) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He
22220 crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux
22221 sont faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks) Rien
22222 va plus! (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He
22223 springs off into vacuum.)_
22224 
22225 FLORRY: _(Sinking into torpor, crossing herself secretly)_ The end of
22226 the world!
22227 
22228 A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity
22229 occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares
22230 over coughs and feetshuffling.)_
22231 
22232 THE GRAMOPHONE: Jerusalem!
22233 
22234 Open your gates and sing
22235 
22236 Hosanna...
22237 
22238 A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star fills from it,
22239 proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah.
22240 Along an infinite invisible tightrope taut from zenith to nadir the End
22241 of the World, a twoheaded octopus in gillie's kilts, busby and tartan
22242 filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the form of the
22243 Three Legs of Man.)_
22244 
22245 THE END OF THE WORLD: _(with a Scotch accent)_ Wha'll dance the keel
22246 row, the keel row, the keel row?
22247 
22248 Over the possing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh
22249 as a corncrake's, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with
22250 funnel sleeves he is seen, vergerfaced, above a rostrum about which the
22251 banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)_
22252 
22253 ELIJAH: No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole
22254 Sue, Dove Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths
22255 shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's
22256 time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play
22257 a slick ace. Join on right here. Book through to eternity junction, the
22258 nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the
22259 second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen
22260 Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to
22261 you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos?
22262 No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something
22263 within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama,
22264 an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once
22265 nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back
22266 number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever
22267 was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line
22268 out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know
22269 and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and, getting down to bedrock, A.
22270 J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O. K.
22271 Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up
22272 by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. _(He shouts)_
22273 Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! _(He
22274 sings)_ Jeru...
22275 
22276 THE GRAMOPHONE: _(Drowning his voice)_ Whorusalaminyourhighhohhhh...
22277 The disc rasps gratingly against the needle)_
22278 
22279 THE THREE WHORES: _(Covering their ears, squawk)_ Ahhkkk!
22280 
22281 ELIJAH: _(In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top
22282 of his voice, his arms uplifted)_ Big Brother up there, Mr President,
22283 you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of
22284 believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss
22285 Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems
22286 to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been,
22287 Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long
22288 and help me save our sisters dear. _(He winks at his audience)_ Our Mr
22289 President, he twig the whole lot and he aint saying nothing.
22290 
22291 KITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did
22292 on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in
22293 the brown scapular. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a
22294 working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.
22295 
22296 ZOE-FANNY: I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.
22297 
22298 FLORRY-TERESA: It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of
22299 Hennessy's three star. I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the
22300 bed.
22301 
22302 STEPHEN: In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without
22303 end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.
22304 
22305 The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon,
22306 Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast,
22307 goosestepping, tramp fist past in noisy marching)_
22308 
22309 THE BEATITUDES: _(Incoherently)_ Beer beef battledog buybull businum
22310 barnum buggerum bishop.
22311 
22312 LYSTER: _(In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says
22313 discreetly)_ He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the
22314 light.
22315 
22316 He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser's attire, shinily
22317 laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a
22318 mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizardlettered, and a high pagoda
22319 hat.)_
22320 
22321 BEST: _(Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown
22322 of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot)_ I was
22323 just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know,
22324 Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says.
22325 
22326 JOHN EGLINTON: _(Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it
22327 towards a corner: with carping accent)_ Esthetics and cosmetics are for
22328 the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee
22329 wants the facts and means to get them.
22330 
22331 In the cone of the searchlight behind the coalscuttle, ollave,
22332 holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaun Maclir broods, chin on knees.
22333 He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mouth. About his
22334 head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His
22335 right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by
22336 its two talons.)_
22337 
22338 MANANAUN MACLIR: _(With a voice of waves)_ Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor!
22339 Ma! White yoghin of the gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos.
22340 With a voice of whistling seawind)_ Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't
22341 have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult
22342 of Shakti. _(With a cry of stormbirds)_ Shakti Shiva, darkhidden Father!
22343 He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its
22344 cooperative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with
22345 the vehemence of the ocean.)_ Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the
22346 homestead! I am the dreamery creamery butter.
22347 
22348 A skeleton judashand strangles the light. The green light wanes to
22349 mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)_
22350 
22351 THE GASJET: Pooah! Pfuiiiiiii!
22352 
22353 Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the
22354 mantle.)_
22355 
22356 ZOE: Who has a fag as I'm here?
22357 
22358 LYNCH: _(Tossing a cigarette on to the table)_ Here.
22359 
22360 ZOE: _(Her head perched aside in mock pride)_ Is that the way to hand
22361 the _pot_ to a lady? _(She stretches up to light the cigarette over the
22362 flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch
22363 with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up
22364 her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly
22365 at her cigarette.)_ Can you see the beautyspot of my behind?
22366 
22367 LYNCH: I'm not looking
22368 
22369 ZOE: _(Makes sheep's eyes)_ No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you
22370 suck a lemon?
22371 
22372 Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom,
22373 then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue
22374 fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously,
22375 twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her
22376 spittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag,
22377 basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts
22378 two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several
22379 overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of
22380 parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'connor
22381 Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent.
22382 Two quills project over his ears.)_
22383 
22384 VIRAG: _(Heels together, bows)_ My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely.
22385 He coughs thoughtfully, drily)_ Promiscuous nakedness is much in
22386 evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact
22387 that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you
22388 are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you
22389 perceived? Good.
22390 
22391 BLOOM: Granpapachi. But...
22392 
22393 VIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and
22394 coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of
22395 gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I
22396 should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always
22397 understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of
22398 lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a
22399 word. Hippogriff. Am I right?
22400 
22401 BLOOM: She is rather lean.
22402 
22403 VIRAG: _(Not unpleasantly)_ Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier
22404 pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest
22405 bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull
22406 has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the
22407 attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you
22408 can wear today. Parallax! _(With a nervous twitch of his head)_ Did you
22409 hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!
22410 
22411 BLOOM: _(An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek)_
22412 She seems sad.
22413 
22414 VIRAG: _(Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left
22415 eye with a finger and barks hoarsely)_ Hoax! Beware of the flapper
22416 and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button
22417 discovered by Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon.
22418 More genially)_ Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item
22419 number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe
22420 the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she
22421 bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.
22422 
22423 BLOOM: _(Regretfully)_ When you come out without your gun.
22424 
22425 VIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your
22426 money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...
22427 
22428 BLOOM: With...?
22429 
22430 VIRAG: _(His tongue upcurling)_ Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She
22431 is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in
22432 weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two
22433 protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the
22434 noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional
22435 protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,
22436 which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts
22437 are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers
22438 reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and
22439 gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their
22440 brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That
22441 suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in
22442 it. Lycopodium. _(His throat twitches)_ Slapbang! There he goes again.
22443 
22444 BLOOM: The stye I dislike.
22445 
22446 VIRAG: _(Arches his eyebrows)_ Contact with a goldring, they say.
22447 Argumentum ad feminam_, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece
22448 in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve's
22449 sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. _(He twitches)_ It
22450 is a funny sound. _(He coughs encouragingly)_ But possibly it is only a
22451 wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on
22452 that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.
22453 
22454 BLOOM: _(Reflecting)_ Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This
22455 searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of
22456 accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...
22457 
22458 VIRAG: _(Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking)_ Stop
22459 twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten.
22460 Exercise your mnemotechnic. _La causa h santa_. Tara. Tara. _(Aside)_ He
22461 will surely remember.
22462 
22463 BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over
22464 parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a
22465 deadhand cures. Mnemo?
22466 
22467 VIRAG: _(Excitedly)_ I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. _(He taps his
22468 parchmentroll energetically)_ This book tells you how to act with all
22469 descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite,
22470 melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about
22471 amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with
22472 horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar
22473 and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike
22474 women in male habiliments? _(With a dry snigger)_ You intended to devote
22475 an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer
22476 months of 1886 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate!
22477 From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say?
22478 Or stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case,
22479 those complicated combinations, camiknickers? _(He crows derisively)_
22480 Keekeereekee!
22481 
22482 Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled
22483 mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)_
22484 
22485 BLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence
22486 this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is
22487 will then morrow as now was be past yester.
22488 
22489 VIRAG: _(Prompts in a pig's whisper)_ Insects of the day spend their
22490 brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the
22491 inferiorly pulchritudinous fumale possessing extendified pudendal nerve
22492 in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! _(His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally)_
22493 They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand
22494 five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will
22495 attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt
22496 vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time
22497 we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. _(He coughs and, bending
22498 his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand)_ You shall
22499 find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember
22500 their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the
22501 seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion
22502 which Doctor L.B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to
22503 example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That
22504 is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley!
22505 He blows into bloom's ear)_ Buzz!
22506 
22507 BLOOM: Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self
22508 then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...
22509 
22510 VIRAG: _(His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key)_ Splendid!
22511 Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. _(He gobbles
22512 gluttonously with turkey wattles)_ Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are
22513 we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! _(He unrolls his parchment rapidly and
22514 reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he
22515 claws)_ Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters will
22516 shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may
22517 help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister
22518 omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or
22519 viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. _(He wags his head with
22520 cackling raillery)_ Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular. _(He
22521 sneezes)_ Amen!
22522 
22523 BLOOM: _(Absently)_ Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open
22524 sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve
22525 and the serpent contradicts. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy
22526 to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way
22527 through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like
22528 those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.
22529 
22530 VIRAG: _(His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly
22531 closed, psalms in outlandish monotone)_ That the cows with their those
22532 distended udders that they have been the the known...
22533 
22534 BLOOM: I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. _(He repeats)_
22535 Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their
22536 teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. _(Profoundly)_ Instinct
22537 rules the world. In life. In death.
22538 
22539 VIRAG: _(Head askew, arches his back and hunched wingshoulders, peers
22540 at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a horning claw and cries)_
22541 Who's moth moth? Who's dear Gerald? Dear Ger, that you? O dear, he is
22542 Gerald. O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe
22543 pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass
22544 tablenumpkin? _(He mews)_ Puss puss puss puss! _(He sighs, draws back
22545 and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw)_ Well, well. He doth
22546 rest anon. (He snaps his jaws suddenly on the air)
22547 
22548 THE MOTH:
22549 
22550      I'm a tiny tiny thing
22551      Ever flying in the spring
22552      Round and round a ringaring.
22553      Long ago I was a king
22554      Now I do this kind of thing
22555      On the wing, on the wing!
22556      Bing!
22557 
22558 He rushes against the mauve shade, flapping noisily)_ Pretty pretty
22559 pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.
22560 
22561 From left upper entrance with two gliding steps Henry Flower comes
22562 forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed
22563 sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed
22564 bamboo Jacob's pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears
22565 dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's
22566 face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and
22567 sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles
22568 down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his
22569 amorous tongue.)_
22570 
22571 HENRY: _(In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar)_
22572 There is a flower that bloometh.
22573 
22574 Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards
22575 Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendant dewlap to the piano.)_
22576 
22577 STEPHEN: _(To himself)_ Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my
22578 belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my.
22579 Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old
22580 Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep
22581 impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially
22582 drunk, by the way. _(He touches the keys again)_ Minor chord comes now.
22583 Yes. Not much however.
22584 
22585 Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous
22586 moustachework.)_
22587 
22588 ARTIFONI: _Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto._
22589 
22590 FLORRY: Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.
22591 
22592 STEPHEN: No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you
22593 the letter about the lute?
22594 
22595 FLORRY: _(Smirking)_ The bird that can sing and won't sing.
22596 
22597 The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober, two Oxford dons with
22598 lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew
22599 Arnold's face.)_
22600 
22601 PHILIP SOBER: Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with
22602 the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve
22603 you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew.
22604 Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street
22605 hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.
22606 
22607 PHILIP DRUNK: _(Impatiently)_ Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way.
22608 If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality.
22609 Who was it told me his name? _(His lawnmower begins to purr)_ Aha, yes.
22610 Zoe mou sas agapo_. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not
22611 Atkinson his card I have somewhere. Mac Somebody. Unmack I have it. He
22612 told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?
22613 
22614 FLORRY: And the song?
22615 
22616 STEPHEN: Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
22617 
22618 FLORRY: Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.
22619 
22620 STEPHEN: Out of it now. _(To himself)_ Clever.
22621 
22622 PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER: _(Their lawnmowers purring with a
22623 rigadoon of grasshalms)_ Clever ever. Out of it out of it. By the
22624 bye have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes.
22625 Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.
22626 
22627 ZOE: There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of
22628 business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to
22629 him. I know you've a Roman collar.
22630 
22631 VIRAG: Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. _(Harshly,
22632 his pupils waxing)_ To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I
22633 am the Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. Why
22634 I left the church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the
22635 Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. _(He wriggles)_ Woman, undoing
22636 with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's
22637 lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat.
22638 Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni
22639 fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. _(He cries) Coactus volui._
22640 Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grapses woman's wrist.
22641 Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat
22642 yadgana. _(He chases his tail)_ Piffpaff! Popo! _(He stops, sneezes)_
22643 Pchp! _(He worries his butt)_ Prrrrrht!
22644 
22645 LYNCH: I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for
22646 shooting a bishop.
22647 
22648 ZOE: _(Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils)_ He couldn't get a
22649 connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.
22650 
22651 BLOOM: Poor man!
22652 
22653 ZOE: _(Lightly)_ Only for what happened him.
22654 
22655 BLOOM: How?
22656 
22657 VIRAG: _(A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage,
22658 cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.)
22659 Verfluchte Goim!_ He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig
22660 God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchia, a Libyan eunuch, the
22661 pope's bastard. _(He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid,
22662 his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world)_
22663 A son of a whore. Apocalypse.
22664 
22665 KITTY: And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from
22666 Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow
22667 and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all
22668 subscribed for the funeral.
22669 
22670 PHILIP DRUNK: _(Gravely) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position,
22671 Philippe?_
22672 
22673 PHILIP SOBER: _(Gaily) c'itait le sacri pigeon, Philippe._
22674 
22675 Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair.
22676 And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a
22677 whore's shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)_
22678 
22679 LYNCH: _(Laughs)_ And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated
22680 anthropoid apes.
22681 
22682 FLORRY: _(Nods)_ Locomotor ataxy.
22683 
22684 ZOE: _(Gaily)_ O, my dictionary.
22685 
22686 LYNCH: Three wise virgins.
22687 
22688 VIRAG: _(Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony
22689 epileptic lips)_ She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orangeflower. Panther,
22690 the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. _(He sticks out
22691 a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork)_
22692 Messiah! He burst her tympanum. _(With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks
22693 his hips in the cynical spasm)_ Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!
22694 
22695 Ben Jumbo Dollard, Rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled,
22696 hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fat-papped, stands
22697 forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing
22698 bagslops.)_
22699 
22700 BEN DOLLARD: _(Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels
22701 jovially in base barreltone)_ When love absorbs my ardent soul.
22702 
22703 The virgins Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley burst through the
22704 ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)_
22705 
22706 THE VIRGINS: _(Gushingly)_ Big Ben! Ben my Chree!
22707 
22708 A VOICE: Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.
22709 
22710 BEN DOLLARD: _(Smites his thigh in abundant laughter)_ Hold him now.
22711 
22712 HENRY: _(Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs)_ Thine
22713 heart, mine love. _(He plucks his lutestrings)_ When first I saw...
22714 
22715 VIRAG: _(Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting)_ Rats!
22716 He yawns, showing a coalblack throat, and closes his jaws by an upward
22717 push of his parchmentroll)_ After having said which I took my departure.
22718 Farewell. Fare thee well. _Dreck!_

22720 Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb
22721 and gives a cow's lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to
22722 the door, his wild harp slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two
22723 ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the
22724 wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)_
22725 
22726 THE FLYBILL: K. II. Post No Bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.
22727 
22728 HENRY: All is lost now.
22729 
22730 Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)_
22731 
22732 VIRAG'S HEAD: Quack!
22733 
22734 Exeunt severally.)_
22735 
22736 STEPHEN: _(Over his shoulder to zoe)_ You would have preferred
22737 the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware
22738 Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Arius Heresiarchus. The
22739 agony in the closet.
22740 
22741 LYNCH: All one and the same God to her.
22742 
22743 STEPHEN: _(Devoutly)_ And sovereign Lord of all things.
22744 
22745 FLORRY: _(To Stephen)_ I'm sure you're a spoiled priest. Or a monk.
22746 
22747 LYNCH: He is. A cardinal's son.
22748 
22749 STEPHEN: Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.
22750 
22751 His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland,
22752 appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven
22753 dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train,
22754 peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His
22755 thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his
22756 neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross.
22757 Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with large wave
22758 gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:)_
22759 
22760 THE CARDINAL:
22761 
22762      Conservio lies captured
22763      He lies in the lowest dungeon
22764      With manacles and chains around his limbs
22765      Weighing upwards of three tons.
22766 
22767 He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left
22768 cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and
22769 fro, arms akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour:)_
22770 
22771      O, the poor little fellow
22772      Hihihihihis legs they were yellow
22773      He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake
22774      But some bloody savage
22775      To graize his white cabbage
22776      He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.
22777 
22778 A multitude of midges swarms white over his robe. He scratches himself
22779 with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims:)_
22780 
22781 I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to
22782 Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd
22783 walk me off the face of the bloody globe.
22784 
22785 His head aslant he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers,
22786 imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying
22787 his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his
22788 trainbearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling,
22789 Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar,
22790 merciful male, melodious:)_
22791 
22792      Shall carry my heart to thee,
22793      Shall carry my heart to thee,
22794      And the breath of the balmy night
22795      Shall carry my heart to thee!
22796      _(The trick doorhandle turns.)_
22797 
22798 
22799 THE DOORHANDLE: Theeee!
22800 
22801 ZOE: The devil is in that door.
22802 
22803 A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking
22804 the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily
22805 and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his
22806 pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)_
22807 
22808 ZOE: _(Sniffs his hair briskly)_ Hmmm! Thank your mother for the
22809 rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.
22810 
22811 BLOOM: _(Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep,
22812 pricks his ears)_ If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double
22813 event?
22814 
22815 ZOE: _(Tears open the silverfoil)_ Fingers was made before forks. _(She
22816 breaks off and nibbles a piece gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then
22817 turns kittenishly to Lynch)_ No objection to French lozenges? _(He nods.
22818 She taunts him.)_ Have it now or wait till you get it? _(He opens his
22819 mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head
22820 follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.)_ Catch!
22821 
22822 She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it
22823 through with a crack.)_
22824 
22825 KITTY: _(Chewing)_ The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have
22826 lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with
22827 his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.
22828 
22829 BLOOM: _(In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic
22830 forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance
22831 towards the door. Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift
22832 pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing
22833 his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.)_ Go, go, go, I conjure
22834 you, whoever you are!
22835 
22836 A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside.
22837 Bloom's features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing
22838 calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)_
22839 
22840 BLOOM: _(Solemnly)_ Thanks.
22841 
22842 ZOE: Do as you're bid. Here!
22843 
22844 A firm heelclacking tread is heard on the stairs.)_
22845 
22846 BLOOM: _(Takes the chocolate)_ Aphrodisiac? Tansy and pennyroyal. But I
22847 bought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red
22848 influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This
22849 black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. _(He eats)_ Influence
22850 taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That
22851 priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.
22852 
22853 The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters. She
22854 is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with
22855 tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like
22856 Minnie Hauck in_ Carmen. _On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings.
22857 Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her
22858 olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted
22859 nostrils. She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)_
22860 
22861 BELLA: My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.
22862 
22863 She glances round her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with
22864 hard insistence. Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated faceneck
22865 and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)_
22866 
22867 THE FAN: _(Flirting quickly, then slowly)_ Married, I see.
22868 
22869 BLOOM: Yes. Partly, I have mislaid...
22870 
22871 THE FAN: _(Half opening, then closing)_ And the missus is master.
22872 Petticoat government.
22873 
22874 BLOOM: _(Looks down with a sheepish grin)_ That is so.
22875 
22876 THE FAN: _(Folding together, rests against her left eardrop)_ Have you
22877 forgotten me?
22878 
22879 BLOOM: Yes. Yo.
22880 
22881 THE FAN: _(Folded akimbo against her waist)_ Is me her was you dreamed
22882 before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now
22883 we?
22884 
22885 Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)_
22886 
22887 BLOOM: _(Wincing)_ Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which
22888 women love.
22889 
22890 THE FAN: _(Tapping)_ We have met. You are mine. It is fate.
22891 
22892 BLOOM: _(Cowed)_ Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your
22893 domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to
22894 speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before
22895 the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door
22896 and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per
22897 second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant
22898 a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family.
22899 Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed
22900 in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the
22901 end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with
22902 Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle as you probably... _(He
22903 winces)_ Ah!
22904 
22905 RICHIE GOULDING: _(Bagweighted, passes the door)_ Mocking is catch. Best
22906 value in Dub. Fit for a prince's. Liver and kidney.
22907 
22908 THE FAN: _(Tapping)_ All things end. Be mine. Now.
22909 
22910 BLOOM: _(Undecided)_ All now? I should not have parted with my talisman.
22911 Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my time of
22912 life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.
22913 
22914 THE FAN: _(Points downwards slowly)_ You may.
22915 
22916 BLOOM: _(Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace)_ We are
22917 observed.
22918 
22919 THE FAN: _(Points downwards quickly)_ You must.
22920 
22921 BLOOM: _(With desire, with reluctance)_ I can make a true black knot.
22922 Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for
22923 Kellett's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy.
22924 I knelt once before today. Ah!
22925 
22926 Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the
22927 edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.
22928 Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers
22929 draws out and in her laces.)_
22930 
22931 BLOOM: _(Murmurs lovingly)_ To be a shoefitter in Manfield's was my
22932 love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace
22933 up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so
22934 incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model
22935 Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb
22936 toe, as worn in Paris.
22937 
22938 THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.
22939 
22940 BLOOM: _(Crosslacing)_ Too tight?
22941 
22942 THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.
22943 
22944 BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar
22945 dance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned.
22946 That night she met... Now!
22947 
22948 He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises
22949 his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow. His eyes grow
22950 dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)_
22951 
22952 BLOOM: _(Mumbles)_ Awaiting your further orders we remain, gentlemen,...
22953 
22954 BELLO: _(With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice)_ Hound of
22955 dishonour!
22956 
22957 BLOOM: _(Infatuated)_ Empress!
22958 
22959 BELLO: _(His heavy cheekchops sagging)_ Adorer of the adulterous rump!
22960 
22961 BLOOM: _(Plaintively)_ Hugeness!
22962 
22963 BELLO: Dungdevourer!
22964 
22965 BLOOM: _(With sinews semiflexed)_ Magmagnificence!
22966 
22967 BELLO: Down! _(He taps her on the shoulder with his fan)_ Incline feet
22968 forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall. You are falling.
22969 On the hands down!
22970 
22971 BLOOM: _(Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps)_
22972 Truffles!
22973 
22974 With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting,
22975 snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut
22976 tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most
22977 excellent master.)_
22978 
22979 BELLO: _(With bobbed hair, purple gills, fit moustache rings round his
22980 shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport
22981 skirt and alpine hat with moorcock's feather, his hands stuck deep in
22982 his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in)_
22983 Footstool! Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of
22984 your despot's glorious heels so glistening in their proud erectness.
22985 
22986 BLOOM: _(Enthralled, bleats)_ I promise never to disobey.
22987 
22988 BELLO: _(Laughs loudly)_ Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for
22989 you. I'm the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet
22990 Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me,
22991 I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be
22992 inflicted in gym costume.
22993 
22994 Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.)_
22995 
22996 ZOE: _(Widening her slip to screen her)_ She's not here.
22997 
22998 BLOOM: _(Closing her eyes)_ She's not here.
22999 
23000 FLORRY: _(Hiding her with her gown)_ She didn't mean it, Mr Bello.
23001 She'll be good, sir.
23002 
23003 KITTY: Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.
23004 
23005 BELLO: _(Coaxingly)_ Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you, darling,
23006 just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk,
23007 sweety. _(Bloom puts out her timid head)_ There's a good girly now.
23008 Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward)_ I only want
23009 to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender
23010 behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.
23011 
23012 BLOOM: _(Fainting)_ Don't tear my...
23013 
23014 BELLO: _(Savagely)_ The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging
23015 hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian
23016 slave of old. You're in for it this time! I'll make you remember me for
23017 the balance of your natural life. _(His forehead veins swollen, his face
23018 congested)_ I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after
23019 my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat hamrashers and a bottle
23020 of Guinness's porter. _(He belches)_ And suck my thumping good Stock
23021 Exchange cigar while I read the _Licensed Victualler's Gazette_. Very
23022 possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and
23023 enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted
23024 and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will
23025 hurt you. _(He twists her arm. Bloom squeals, turning turtle.)_
23026 
23027 BLOOM: Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!
23028 
23029 BELLO: _(Twisting)_ Another!
23030 
23031 BLOOM: _(Screams)_ O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches
23032 like mad!
23033 
23034 BELLO: _(Shouts)_ Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best
23035 bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn
23036 you! _(He slaps her face)_
23037 
23038 BLOOM: _(Whimpers)_ You're after hitting me. I'll tell...
23039 
23040 BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.
23041 
23042 ZOE: Yes. Walk on him! I will.
23043 
23044 FLORRY: I will. Don't be greedy.
23045 
23046 KITTY: No, me. Lend him to me.
23047 
23048 The brothel cook, mrs keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib,
23049 men's grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin stuck
23050 with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)_
23051 
23052 MRS KEOGH: _(Ferociously)_ Can I help? _(They hold and pinion Bloom.)_
23053 
23054 BELLO: _(Squats with a grunt on Bloom's upturned face, puffing
23055 cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg)_ I see Keating Clay is elected
23056 vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness's preference
23057 shares are at sixteen three quaffers. Curse me for a fool that didn't
23058 buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck,
23059 curse it. And that Goddamned outsider _Throwaway_ at twenty to one.
23060 He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear)_ Where's that Goddamned
23061 cursed ashtray?
23062 
23063 BLOOM: _(Goaded, buttocksmothered)_ O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!
23064 
23065 BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg. Pray for it as you never
23066 prayed before. _(He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar)_ Here,
23067 kiss that. Both. Kiss. _(He throws a leg astride and, pressing with
23068 horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice)_ Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury
23069 cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. _(He bends sideways and
23070 squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting)_ Ho! Off we pop! I'll
23071 nurse you in proper fashion. _(He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the
23072 saddle)_ The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot
23073 and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.
23074 
23075 FLORRY: _(Pulls at Bello)_ Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked
23076 before you.
23077 
23078 ZOE: _(Pulling at florry)_ Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet,
23079 suckeress?
23080 
23081 BLOOM: _(Stifling)_ Can't.
23082 
23083 BELLO: Well, I'm not. Wait. _(He holds in his breath)_ Curse it. Here.
23084 This bung's about burst. _(He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting
23085 his features, farts loudly)_ Take that! _(He recorks himself)_ Yes, by
23086 Jingo, sixteen three quarters.
23087 
23088 BLOOM: _(A sweat breaking out over him)_ Not man. _(He sniffs)_ Woman.
23089 
23090 BELLO: _(Stands up)_ No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has
23091 come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing
23092 under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male
23093 garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously
23094 rustling over head and shoulders. And quickly too!
23095 
23096 BLOOM: _(Shrinks)_ Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I
23097 tiptouch it with my nails?
23098 
23099 BELLO: _(Points to his whores)_ As they are now so will you be, wigged,
23100 singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape
23101 measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel
23102 force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to
23103 the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure,
23104 plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks,
23105 pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course,
23106 with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice
23107 scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be
23108 a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly
23109 flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...
23110 
23111 BLOOM: _(A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large
23112 male hands and nose, leering mouth)_ I tried her things on only twice,
23113 a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hard up I washed them to
23114 save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.
23115 
23116 BELLO: _(Jeers)_ Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh? And showed
23117 off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds
23118 your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders in various poses of surrender,
23119 eh? Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and
23120 short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that
23121 Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel, eh?
23122 
23123 BLOOM: Miriam. Black. Demimondaine.
23124 
23125 BELLO: _(Guffaws)_ Christ Almighty it's too tickling, this! You were
23126 a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and
23127 lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be
23128 violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M.
23129 P., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy,
23130 Henri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus, the
23131 varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland
23132 and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. _(He guffaws again)_ Christ,
23133 wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?
23134 
23135 BLOOM: _(Her hands and features working)_ It was Gerald converted me to
23136 be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School
23137 play _Vice Versa_. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by
23138 sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his
23139 eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.
23140 
23141 BELLO: _(With wicked glee)_ Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you
23142 took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the
23143 smoothworn throne.
23144 
23145 BLOOM: Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. _(Earnestly)_
23146 And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet...
23147 
23148 BELLO: _(Sternly)_ No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the
23149 corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it
23150 standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a
23151 trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a
23152 martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.
23153 
23154 THE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices)_ He went through a form
23155 of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
23156 Black church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn
23157 at an address in D'Olier street while he presented himself indecently to
23158 the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly encouraged
23159 a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary
23160 outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences
23161 he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all
23162 strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did
23163 he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and
23164 what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar,
23165 gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to
23166 him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?
23167 
23168 BELLO: _(Whistles loudly)_ Say! What was the most revolting piece of
23169 obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out! Be
23170 candid for once.
23171 
23172 Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering,
23173 Booloohoom. Poldy Kock, Bootlaces a penny Cassidy's hag, blind
23174 stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other,
23175 the...)_
23176 
23177 BLOOM: Don't ask me! Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought
23178 the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...
23179 
23180 BELLO: _(Peremptorily)_ Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing.
23181 Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good ghoststory or a
23182 line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how
23183 many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr...
23184 
23185 BLOOM: _(Docile, gurgles)_ I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant
23186 
23187 BELLO: _(Imperiously)_ O, get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak
23188 when you're spoken to.
23189 
23190 BLOOM: _(Bows)_ Master! Mistress! Mantamer!
23191 
23192 He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fill.)_
23193 
23194 BELLO: _(Satirically)_ By day you will souse and bat our smelling
23195 underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines
23196 with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be
23197 nice? _(He places a ruby ring on her finger)_ And there now! With this
23198 ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.
23199 
23200 BLOOM: Thank you, mistress.
23201 
23202 BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in
23203 the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one.
23204 Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.
23205 Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I'll lecture you
23206 on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss,
23207 with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night
23208 your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves
23209 newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such
23210 favours knights of old laid down their lives. _(He chuckles)_ My boys
23211 will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above
23212 all, when they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new
23213 attraction in gilded heels. First I'll have a go at you myself. A man I
23214 know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just
23215 now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is
23216 on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust.
23217 Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? _(He points)_ For that lot. Trained
23218 by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. _(He bares his arm and
23219 plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva)_ There's fine depth for you!
23220 What, boys? That give you a hardon? _(He shoves his arm in a bidder's
23221 face)_ Here wet the deck and wipe it round!
23222 
23223 A BIDDER: A florin.
23224 
23225 Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)_
23226 
23227 THE LACQUEY: Barang!
23228 
23229 A VOICE: One and eightpence too much.
23230 
23231 CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.
23232 
23233 BELLO: _(Gives a rap with his gavel)_ Two bar. Rockbottom figure and
23234 cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points.
23235 Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If
23236 I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid
23237 gallons a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His
23238 sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks.
23239 Whoa my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! _(He brands his initial C on Bloom's
23240 croup)_ So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?
23241 
23242 A DARKVISAGED MAN: _(In disguised accent)_ Hoondert punt sterlink.
23243 
23244 VOICES: _(Subdued)_ For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.
23245 
23246 BELLO: _(Gaily)_ Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short
23247 skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a
23248 potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the
23249 long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better
23250 instincts of the _blasi_ man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk
23251 on four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup,
23252 the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of
23253 fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.
23254 
23255 BLOOM: _(Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with
23256 forefinger in mouth)_ O, I know what you're hinting at now!
23257 
23258 BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? _(He
23259 stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds
23260 of Bloom's haunches)_ Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your
23261 curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy,
23262 sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy
23263 a bucket or sell your pump. _(Loudly)_ Can you do a man's job?
23264 
23265 BLOOM: Eccles street...
23266 
23267 BELLO: _(Sarcastically)_ I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but
23268 there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my
23269 gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for
23270 you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all
23271 over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee,
23272 belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he
23273 has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months,
23274 my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts
23275 already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? _(He spits in
23276 contempt)_ Spittoon!
23277 
23278 BLOOM: I was indecently treated, I... Inform the police. Hundred
23279 pounds. Unmentionable. I...
23280 
23281 BELLO: Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want not your
23282 drizzle.
23283 
23284 BLOOM: To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll... We... Still...
23285 
23286 BELLO: _(Ruthlessly)_ No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will
23287 since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years.
23288 Return and see.
23289 
23290 Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)_
23291 
23292 SLEEPY HOLLOW: Rip van Wink! Rip van Winkle!
23293 
23294 BLOOM: _(In tattered mocassins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tiptoeing,
23295 fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond
23296 panes, cries out)_ I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's!
23297 But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he...
23298 
23299 BELLO: _(Laughs mockingly)_ That's your daughter, you owl, with a
23300 Mullingar student.
23301 
23302 Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her blue scarf
23303 in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and
23304 calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)_
23305 
23306 MILLY: My! It's Papli! But, O Papli, how old you've grown!
23307 
23308 BELLO: Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote,
23309 aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and
23310 his menfriends are living there in clover. The _Cuckoos' Rest!_ Why not?
23311 How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets, flatfoot,
23312 exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male prostitute?
23313 Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the
23314 goose, my gander O.
23315 
23316 BLOOM: They... I...
23317 
23318 BELLO: _(Cuttingly)_ Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet
23319 you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to
23320 find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue
23321 you carried home in the rain for art for art' sake. They will violate
23322 the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook
23323 of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten
23324 shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.
23325 
23326 BLOOM: Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return.
23327 I will prove...
23328 
23329 A VOICE: Swear!
23330 
23331 Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowieknife between his
23332 teeth.)_
23333 
23334 BELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your
23335 secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You
23336 are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.
23337 
23338 BLOOM: Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody...? _(He bites his
23339 thumb)_
23340 
23341 BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency
23342 or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you
23343 skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have!
23344 If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury
23345 you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck
23346 Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and
23347 sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands,
23348 whatever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. _(He
23349 explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh)_ We'll manure you, Mr Flower! _(He
23350 pipes scoffingly)_ Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!
23351 
23352 BLOOM: _(Clasps his head)_ My willpower! Memory! I have sinned! I have
23353 suff...
23354 
23355 He weeps tearlessly)_
23356 
23357 BELLO: _(Sneers)_ Crybabby! Crocodile tears!
23358 
23359 Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to
23360 the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the
23361 circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M.
23362 Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater, Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M.
23363 Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, P. Mastiansky, The Reverend Leopold
23364 Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the
23365 recreant Bloom.)_
23366 
23367 THE CIRCUMCISED: _(In dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit
23368 upon him, no flowers) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad._
23369 
23370 VOICES: _(Sighing)_ So he's gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never
23371 heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah,
23372 yes.
23373 
23374 From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of
23375 incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oakframe a nymph with
23376 hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her
23377 grotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over Bloom.)_
23378 
23379 THE YEWS: _(Their leaves whispering)_ Sister. Our sister. Ssh!
23380 
23381 THE NYMPH: _(Softly)_ Mortal! _(Kindly)_ Nay, dost not weepest!
23382 
23383 BLOOM: _(Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight,
23384 with dignity)_ This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of
23385 habit.
23386 
23387 THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster
23388 picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in
23389 fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical
23390 act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt
23391 of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to
23392 disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads,
23393 proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured
23394 gentleman. Useful hints to the married.
23395 
23396 BLOOM: _(Lifts a turtle head towards her lap)_ We have met before. On
23397 another star.
23398 
23399 THE NYMPH: _(Sadly)_ Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the
23400 aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited
23401 testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust
23402 developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.
23403 
23404 BLOOM: You mean _Photo Bits?_
23405 
23406 THE NYMPH: I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me
23407 above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in
23408 four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my
23409 shame.
23410 
23411 BLOOM: _(Humbly kisses her long hair)_ Your classic curves, beautiful
23412 immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,
23413 almost to pray.
23414 
23415 THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.
23416 
23417 BLOOM: _(Quickly)_ Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst
23418 side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of bed
23419 or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest
23420 there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days
23421 ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless, inoffensive
23422 vent. _(He sighs)_ 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.
23423 
23424 THE NYMPH: _(Her fingers in her ears)_ And words. They are not in my
23425 dictionary.
23426 
23427 BLOOM: You understood them?
23428 
23429 THE YEWS: Ssh!
23430 
23431 THE NYMPH: _(Covers her face with her hands)_ What have I not seen in
23432 that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?
23433 
23434 BLOOM: _(Apologetically)_ I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up
23435 with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.
23436 
23437 THE NYMPH: _(Bends her head)_ Worse, worse!
23438 
23439 BLOOM: _(Reflects precautiously)_ That antiquated commode. It wasn't her
23440 weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds
23441 after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd
23442 orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.
23443 
23444 The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)_
23445 
23446 THE WATERFALL:
23447 
23448      Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
23449      Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.
23450 
23451 THE YEWS: _(Mingling their boughs)_ Listen. Whisper. She is right, our
23452 sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous
23453 summer days.
23454 
23455 
23456 JOHN WYSE NOLAN: _(In the background, in Irish National Forester's
23457 uniform, doffs his plumed hat)_ Prosper! Give shade on languorous days,
23458 trees of Ireland!
23459 
23460 THE YEWS: _(Murmuring)_ Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School
23461 excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?
23462 
23463 BLOOM: _(Scared)_ High School of Poula? Mnemo? Not in full possession of
23464 faculties. Concussion. Run over by tram.
23465 
23466 THE ECHO: Sham!
23467 
23468 BLOOM: _(Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript
23469 juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis
23470 shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with
23471 badge)_ I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a
23472 jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory,
23473 the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes,
23474 instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles
23475 vice), even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were
23476 sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.
23477 
23478 Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and
23479 shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen
23480 Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing
23481 of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)_
23482 
23483 THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray! _(They cheer)_
23484 
23485 BLOOM: _(Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent
23486 snowballs, struggles to rise)_ Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's
23487 ring all the bells in Montague street. _(He cheers feebly)_ Hurray for
23488 the High School!
23489 
23490 THE ECHO: Fool!
23491 
23492 THE YEWS: _(Rustling)_ She is right, our sister. Whisper. _(Whispered
23493 kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from
23494 the boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom.)_ Who
23495 profaned our silent shade?
23496 
23497 THE NYMPH: _(Coyly, through parting fingers)_ There? In the open air?
23498 
23499 THE YEWS: _(Sweeping downward)_ Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.
23500 
23501 THE WATERFALL:
23502 
23503      Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
23504      Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.
23505 
23506 THE NYMPH: _(With wide fingers)_ O, infamy!
23507 
23508 BLOOM: I was precocious. Youth. The fauna. I sacrificed to the god of
23509 the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing
23510 time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke,
23511 flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains
23512 with poor papa's operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled
23513 downhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits.
23514 She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The
23515 demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?
23516 
23517 Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with
23518 humid nostrils through the foliage.)_
23519 
23520 STAGGERING BOB: (LARGE TEARDROPS ROLLING FROM HIS PROMINENT EYES,
23521 SNIVELS) Me. Me see.
23522 
23523 BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I... _(With pathos)_ No girl would when
23524 I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play...
23525 
23526 High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes,
23527 plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)_
23528 
23529 THE NANNYGOAT: _(Bleats)_ Megeggaggegg! Nannannanny!
23530 
23531 BLOOM: _(Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and
23532 gorsespine)_ Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. _(He gazes
23533 intently downwards on the water)_ Thirtytwo head over heels per second.
23534 Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government
23535 printer's clerk. _(Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom,
23536 rolled in a mummy, rolls roteatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the
23537 purple waiting waters.)_
23538 
23539 THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!
23540 
23541 Far out in the bay between bailey and kish lights the_ Erin's King
23542 sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards
23543 the land.)_
23544 
23545 COUNCILLOR NANNETII: _(Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellowkitefaced,
23546 his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims)_ When my country takes her
23547 place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let my
23548 epitaph be written. I have...
23549 
23550 BLOOM: Done. Prff!
23551 
23552 THE NYMPH: _(Loftily)_ We immortals, as you saw today, have not such
23553 a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat
23554 electric light. _(She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing
23555 her forefinger in her mouth)_ Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then
23556 could you...?
23557 
23558 BLOOM: _(Pawing the heather abjectly)_ O, I have been a perfect pig.
23559 Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia to which
23560 add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's
23561 syringe, the ladies' friend.
23562 
23563 THE NYMPH: In my presence. The powderpuff. _(She blushes and makes a
23564 knee)_ And the rest!
23565 
23566 BLOOM: _(Dejected)_ Yes. _Peccavi!_ I have paid homage on that living
23567 altar where the back changes name. _(With sudden fervour)_ For why
23568 should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...?
23569 
23570 Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems,
23571 cooeeing)_
23572 
23573 THE VOICE OF KITTY: _(In the thicket)_ Show us one of them cushions.
23574 
23575 THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.
23576 
23577 A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)_
23578 
23579 THE VOICE OF LYNCH: _(In the thicket)_ Whew! Piping hot!
23580 
23581 THE VOICE OF ZOE: _(From the thicket)_ Came from a hot place.
23582 
23583 THE VOICE OF VIRAG: _(A birdchief, bluestreaked and feathered in war
23584 panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over
23585 beechmast and acorns)_ Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
23586 
23587 BLOOM: It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit
23588 where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to
23589 grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted
23590 white sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.
23591 
23592 THE WATERFALL:
23593 
23594      _Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
23595      Poulaphouca Poulaphouca._
23596 
23597 THE YEWS: Ssh! Sister, speak!
23598 
23599 THE NYMPH: _(Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and hugewinged wimple,
23600 softly, with remote eyes)_ Tranquilla convent. Sister Agatha. Mount
23601 Carmel. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. _(She
23602 reclines her head, sighing)_ Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull
23603 waves o'er the waters dull.
23604 
23605 Bloom half rises. His back trouserbutton snaps.)_
23606 
23607 THE BUTTON: Bip!
23608 
23609 Two sluts of the coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)_
23610 
23611 THE SLUTS:
23612 
23613      O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
23614      He didn't know what to do,
23615      To keep it up,
23616      To keep it up.
23617 
23618 BLOOM: _(Coldly)_ You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there
23619 were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy
23620 but willing like an ass pissing.
23621 
23622 THE YEWS: _(Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms
23623 aging and swaying)_ Deciduously!
23624 
23625 THE NYMPH: _(Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her habit)_
23626 Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! _(A large moist stain appears on her
23627 robe)_ Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a
23628 pure woman. _(She clutches again in her robe)_ Wait. Satan, you'll sing
23629 no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. _(She draws a poniard and,
23630 clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his
23631 loins)_ Nekum!
23632 
23633 BLOOM: _(Starts up, seizes her hand)_ Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat o' nine lives!
23634 Fair play, madam. No pruningknife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What
23635 do you lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? _(He
23636 clutches her veil)_ A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener,
23637 or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother Alphonsus,
23638 eh Reynard?
23639 
23640 THE NYMPH: _(With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast
23641 cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks)_ Poli...!
23642 
23643 BLOOM: _(Calls after her)_ As if you didn't get it on the double
23644 yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it.
23645 Your strength our weakness. What's our studfee? What will you pay on
23646 the nail? You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read. _(The fleeing nymph
23647 raises a keen)_ Eh? I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind
23648 me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool
23649 someone else, not me. _(He sniffs)_ Rut. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.
23650 
23651 The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)_
23652 
23653 BELLA: You'll know me the next time.
23654 
23655 BLOOM: _(Composed, regards her) Passie._ Mutton dressed as lamb. Long
23656 in the tooth and superfluous hair. A raw onion the last thing at night
23657 would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your
23658 eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. They have the
23659 dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw
23660 propeller.
23661 
23662 BELLA: _(Contemptuously)_ You're not game, in fact. _(Her sowcunt
23663 barks)_ Fbhracht!
23664 
23665 BLOOM: _(Contemptuously)_ Clean your nailless middle finger first, your
23666 bully's cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of
23667 hay and wipe yourself.
23668 
23669 BELLA: I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!
23670 
23671 BLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!
23672 
23673 BELLA: _(Turns to the piano)_ Which of you was playing the dead march
23674 from _Saul?_
23675 
23676 ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. _(She darts to the piano and bangs
23677 chords on it with crossed arms)_ The cat's ramble through the slag.
23678 She glances back)_ Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? _(She darts
23679 back to the table)_ What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.
23680 
23681 Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom
23682 approaches Zoe.)_
23683 
23684 BLOOM: _(Gently)_ Give me back that potato, will you?
23685 
23686 ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.
23687 
23688 BLOOM: _(With feeling)_ It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor mamma.
23689 
23690 ZOE:
23691 
23692      Give a thing and take it back
23693      God'll ask you where is that
23694      You'll say you don't know
23695      God'll send you down below.
23696 
23697 BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.
23698 
23699 STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.
23700 
23701 ZOE: Here. _(She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh,
23702 and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking)_ Those that hides
23703 knows where to find.
23704 
23705 BELLA: _(Frowns)_ Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you
23706 smash that piano. Who's paying here?
23707 
23708 She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out
23709 a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)_
23710 
23711 STEPHEN: _(With exaggerated politeness)_ This silken purse I made out
23712 of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. _(He
23713 indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom)_ We are all in the same sweepstake,
23714 Kinch and Lynch. _Dans ce bordel ou tenons nostre itat_.
23715 
23716 LYNCH: _(Calls from the hearth)_ Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.
23717 
23718 STEPHEN: _(Hands Bella a coin)_ Gold. She has it.
23719 
23720 BELLA: _(Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and
23721 Kitty)_ Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.
23722 
23723 STEPHEN: _(Delightedly)_ A hundred thousand apologies. _(He fumbles
23724 again and takes out and hands her two crowns)_ Permit, _brevi manu_, my
23725 sight is somewhat troubled.
23726 
23727 Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to
23728 himself in monosyllables. Zoe bends over the table. Kitty leans over
23729 Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist,
23730 adds his head to the group.)_
23731 
23732 FLORRY: _(Strives heavily to rise)_ Ow! My foot's asleep. _(She limps
23733 over to the table. Bloom approaches.)_
23734 
23735 BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: _(Chattering and squabbling)_ The
23736 gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three... allow me a
23737 moment... this gentleman pays separate... who's touching it?... ow!
23738  mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short
23739 time?... who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentleman paid
23740 down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.
23741 
23742 STEPHEN: _(At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence)_ No bottles!
23743 What, eleven? A riddle!
23744 
23745 ZOE: _(Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the
23746 top of her stocking)_ Hard earned on the flat of my back.
23747 
23748 LYNCH: _(Lifting Kitty from the table)_ Come!
23749 
23750 KITTY: Wait. _(She clutches the two crowns)_
23751 
23752 FLORRY: And me?
23753 
23754 LYNCH: Hoopla! _(He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the
23755 sofa.)_
23756 
23757 STEPHEN:
23758 
23759      The fox crew, the cocks flew,
23760      The bells in heaven
23761      Were striking eleven.
23762      'Tis time for her poor soul
23763      To get out of heaven.
23764 
23765 BLOOM: _(Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between bella and
23766 florry)_ So. Allow me. _(He takes up the poundnote)_ Three times ten.
23767 We're square.
23768 
23769 BELLA: _(Admiringly)_ You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss
23770 you.
23771 
23772 ZOE: _(Points)_ Him? Deep as a drawwell. _(Lynch bends Kitty back over
23773 the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)_
23774 
23775 BLOOM: This is yours.
23776 
23777 STEPHEN: How is that? _Les distrait_ or absentminded beggar. _(He
23778 fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object
23779 fills.)_ That fell.
23780 
23781 BLOOM: _(Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches)_ This.
23782 
23783 STEPHEN: Lucifer. Thanks.
23784 
23785 BLOOM: _(Quietly)_ You had better hand over that cash to me to take care
23786 of. Why pay more?
23787 
23788 STEPHEN: _(Hands him all his coins)_ Be just before you are generous.
23789 
23790 BLOOM: I will but is it wise? _(He counts)_ One, seven, eleven, and
23791 five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.
23792 
23793 STEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next
23794 Lessing says. Thirsty fox. _(He laughs loudly)_ Burying his grandmother.
23795 Probably he killed her.
23796 
23797 BLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.
23798 
23799 STEPHEN: Doesn't matter a rambling damn.
23800 
23801 BLOOM: No, but...
23802 
23803 STEPHEN: _(Comes to the table)_ Cigarette, please. _(Lynch tosses a
23804 cigarette from the sofa to the table)_ And so Georgina Johnson is dead
23805 and married. _(A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it)_
23806 Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. _(He strikes a match and proceeds to
23807 light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy)_
23808 
23809 LYNCH: _(Watching him)_ You would have a better chance of lighting it if
23810 you held the match nearer.
23811 
23812 STEPHEN: _(Brings the match near his eye)_ Lynx eye. Must get glasses.
23813 Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all
23814 flat. _(He draws the match away. It goes out.)_ Brain thinks. Near:
23815 far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. _(He frowns mysteriously)_ Hm.
23816 Sphinx. The beast that has twobacks at midnight. Married.
23817 
23818 ZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with
23819 him.
23820 
23821 FLORRY: _(Nods)_ Mr Lambe from London.
23822 
23823 STEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.
23824 
23825 LYNCH: _(Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply) Dona nobis pacem._
23826 
23827 The cigarette slips from Stephen 's fingers. Bloom picks it up and
23828 throws it in the grate.)_
23829 
23830 BLOOM: Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. _(To Zoe)_ You
23831 have nothing?
23832 
23833 ZOE: Is he hungry?
23834 
23835 STEPHEN: _(Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the
23836 bloodoath in the_ Dusk of the Gods)
23837 
23838      Hangende Hunger,
23839      Fragende Frau,
23840      Macht uns alle kaputt.
23841 
23842 
23843 ZOE: _(Tragically)_ Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! _(She takes
23844 his hand)_ Blue eyes beauty I'll read your hand. _(She points to his
23845 forehead)_ No wit, no wrinkles. _(She counts)_ Two, three, Mars, that's
23846 courage. _(Stephen shakes his head)_ No kid.
23847 
23848 LYNCH: Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and
23849 shake. _(To Zoe)_ Who taught you palmistry?
23850 
23851 ZOE: _(Turns)_ Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. _(To Stephen)_ I see
23852 it in your face. The eye, like that. _(She frowns with lowered head)_
23853 
23854 LYNCH: _(Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice)_ Like that. Pandybat.
23855 
23856 Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open,
23857 the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)_
23858 
23859 FATHER DOLAN: Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little
23860 schemer. See it in your eye.
23861 
23862 Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises
23863 from the pianola coffin.)_
23864 
23865 DON JOHN CONMEE: Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very
23866 good little boy!
23867 
23868 ZOE: _(Examining Stephen's palm)_ Woman's hand.
23869 
23870 STEPHEN: _(Murmurs)_ Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read
23871 His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.
23872 
23873 ZOE: What day were you born?
23874 
23875 STEPHEN: Thursday. Today.
23876 
23877 ZOE: Thursday's child has far to go. _(She traces lines on his hand)_
23878 Line of fate. Influential friends.
23879 
23880 FLORRY: _(Pointing)_ Imagination.
23881 
23882 ZOE: Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... _(She peers at his hands
23883 abruptly)_ I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to
23884 know?
23885 
23886 BLOOM: _(Detaches her fingers and offers his palm)_ More harm than good.
23887 Here. Read mine.
23888 
23889 BELLA: Show. _(She turns up bloom's hand)_ I thought so. Knobby knuckles
23890 for the women.
23891 
23892 ZOE: _(Peering at bloom's palm)_ Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and
23893 marry money.
23894 
23895 BLOOM: Wrong.
23896 
23897 ZOE: _(Quickly)_ O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That
23898 wrong?
23899 
23900 Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises,
23901 stretches her wings and clucks.)_
23902 
23903 BLACK LIZ: Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.
23904 
23905 She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off)_
23906 
23907 BLOOM: _(Points to his hand)_ That weal there is an accident. Fell and
23908 cut it twentytwo years ago. I was sixteen.
23909 
23910 ZOE: I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.
23911 
23912 STEPHEN: See? Moves to one great goal. I am twentytwo. Sixteen years ago
23913 he was twentytwo too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled. Twentytwo
23914 years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. _(He winces)_ Hurt my hand
23915 somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?
23916 
23917 Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and
23918 writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)_
23919 
23920 FLORRY: What?
23921 
23922 A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a
23923 gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue,
23924 Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the
23925 sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the
23926 crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)_
23927 
23928 THE BOOTS: _(Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers)_
23929 Haw haw have you the horn?
23930 
23931 Bronze by gold they whisper.)_
23932 
23933 ZOE: _(To Florry)_ Whisper.
23934 
23935 They whisper again)_
23936 
23937 Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set
23938 sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan in yachtsman's cap and
23939 white shoes officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan's coat
23940 shoulder.)_
23941 
23942 LENEHAN: Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a
23943 few quims?
23944 
23945 BOYLAN: _(Seated, smiles)_ Plucking a turkey.
23946 
23947 LENEHAN: A good night's work.
23948 
23949 BOYLAN: _(Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks)_ Blazes
23950 Kate! Up to sample or your money back. _(He holds out a forefinger)_
23951 Smell that.
23952 
23953 LENEHAN: _(Smells gleefully)_ Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!
23954 
23955 ZOE AND FLORRY: _(Laugh together)_ Ha ha ha ha.
23956 
23957 BOYLAN: _(Jumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear)_
23958 Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom dressed yet?
23959 
23960 BLOOM: _(In flunkey's prune plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings
23961 and powdered wig)_ I'm afraid not, sir. The last articles...
23962 
23963 BOYLAN: _(Tosses him sixpence)_ Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash.
23964 He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head)_ Show me
23965 in. I have a little private business with your wife, you understand?
23966 
23967 BLOOM: Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.
23968 
23969 MARION: He ought to feel himself highly honoured. _(She plops splashing
23970 out of the water)_ Raoul darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only
23971 my new hat and a carriage sponge.
23972 
23973 BOYLAN: _(A merry twinkle in his eye)_ Topping!
23974 
23975 BELLA: What? What is it?
23976 
23977 Zoe whispers to her.)_
23978 
23979 MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll
23980 write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to
23981 raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed
23982 and stamped receipt.
23983 
23984 BOYLAN: (clasps himself) Here, I can't hold this little lot much longer.
23985 he strides off on stiff cavalry legs)
23986 
23987 BELLA: _(Laughing)_ Ho ho ho ho.
23988 
23989 BOYLAN: _(To Bloom, over his shoulder)_ You can apply your eye to the
23990 keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.
23991 
23992 BLOOM: Thank you, sir. I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness
23993 the deed and take a snapshot? _(He holds out an ointment jar)_ Vaseline,
23994 sir? Orangeflower...? Lukewarm water...?
23995 
23996 KITTY: _(From the sofa)_ Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.
23997 
23998 Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur, liplapping
23999 loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)_
24000 
24001 MINA KENNEDY: _(Her eyes upturned)_ O, it must be like the scent of
24002 geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her!
24003 Stuck together! Covered with kisses!
24004 
24005 LYDIA DOUCE: _(Her mouth opening)_ Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round
24006 the room doing it! Ride a cockhorse. You could hear them in Paris and
24007 New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.
24008 
24009 KITTY: _(Laughing)_ Hee hee hee.
24010 
24011 BOYLAN'S VOICE: _(Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach)_ Ah!
24012 Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!
24013 
24014 MARION'S VOICE: _(Hoarsely, sweetly, rising to her throat)_ O!
24015 Weeshwashtkissinapooisthnapoohuck?
24016 
24017 BLOOM: _(His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself)_ Show! Hide! Show!
24018 Plough her! More! Shoot!
24019 
24020 BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY, KITTY: Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!
24021 
24022 LYNCH: _(Points)_ The mirror up to nature. _(He laughs)_ Hu hu hu hu hu!
24023 
24024 Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare,
24025 beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the
24026 reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)_
24027 
24028 SHAKESPEARE: _(In dignified ventriloquy)_ 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks
24029 the vacant mind. _(To Bloom)_ Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest
24030 invisible. Gaze. _(He crows with a black capon's laugh)_ Iagogo! How my
24031 Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymornun. Iagogogo!
24032 
24033 BLOOM: _(Smiles yellowly at the three whores)_ When will I hear the
24034 joke?
24035 
24036 ZOE: Before you're twice married and once a widower.
24037 
24038 BLOOM: Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon when measurements
24039 were taken next the skin after his death...
24040 
24041 Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with
24042 deathtalk, tears and Tunney's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds,
24043 her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a
24044 pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late
24045 husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, large eights. She holds
24046 a Scottish widows' insurance policy and a large marquee umbrella under
24047 which her brood run with her, Patsy hopping on one shod foot, his collar
24048 loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, freddy whimpering, Susy with a
24049 crying cod's mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on,
24050 her streamers flaunting aloft.)_
24051 
24052 FREDDY: Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!
24053 
24054 SUSY: Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!
24055 
24056 SHAKESPEARE: _(With paralytic rage)_ Weda seca whokilla farst.
24057 
24058 The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeare's
24059 beardless face. The marquee umbrella sways drunkenly, the children run
24060 aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and
24061 kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twirling japanesily.)_
24062 
24063 MRS CUNNINGHAM: _(Sings)_
24064 
24065 And they call me the jewel of Asia!
24066 
24067 MARTIN CUNNINGHAM: _(Gazes on her, impassive)_ Immense! Most bloody
24068 awful demirep!
24069 
24070 STEPHEN: _Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti._ Queens lay with prize bulls.
24071 Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgrossfather made the first
24072 confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions
24073 of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was
24074 open.
24075 
24076 BELLA: None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.
24077 
24078 LYNCH: Let him alone. He's back from Paris.
24079 
24080 ZOE: _(Runs to stephen and links him)_ O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.
24081 
24082 Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace where he
24083 stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile
24084 on his face.)_
24085 
24086 LYNCH: _(Oommelling on the sofa)_ Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrrrrrmmmm.
24087 
24088 STEPHEN: _(Gabbles with marionette jerks)_ Thousand places of

24102 
24103 LYNCH: _Vive le vampire!_
24104 
24105 THE WHORES: Bravo! Parleyvoo!
24106 
24107 STEPHEN: _(Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself)_
24108 Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy
24109 apostles big damn ruffians. _Demimondaines_ nicely handsome sparkling of
24110 diamonds very amiable costumed. Or do you are fond better what belongs

24120 laughter)_ An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... omelette on the...

24122 STEPHEN: _(Mincingly)_ I love you, sir darling. Speak you englishman
24123 tongue for _double entente cordiale._ O yes, _mon loup_. How much cost?
24124 Waterloo. Watercloset. _(He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger)_
24125 
24126 BELLA: _(Laughing)_ Omelette...
24127 
24128 THE WHORES: _(Laughing)_ Encore! Encore!
24129 
24130 STEPHEN: Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.
24131 
24132 ZOE: Go abroad and love a foreign lady.
24133 
24134 LYNCH: Across the world for a wife.
24135 
24136 FLORRY: Dreams goes by contraries.
24137 
24138 STEPHEN: _(Extends his arms)_ It was here. Street of harlots. In
24139 Serpentine avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the
24140 red carpet spread?
24141 
24142 BLOOM: _(Approaching Stephen)_ Look...
24143 
24144 STEPHEN: No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World
24145 without end. _(He cries) P_ater! Free!
24146 
24147 BLOOM: I say, look...
24148 
24149 STEPHEN: Break my spirit, will he? _O merde alors! (He cries, his
24150 vulture talons sharpened)_ Hola! Hillyho!
24151 
24152 Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)_
24153 
24154 SIMON: That's all right. _(He swoops uncertainly through the air,
24155 wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard
24156 wings)_ Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those
24157 halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep
24158 our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed.
24159 Ulster king at arms! Haihoop! _(He makes the beagle's call, giving
24160 tongue)_ Bulbul! Burblblburblbl! Hai, boy!
24161 
24162 The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country.
24163 A stout fox, drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his
24164 grandmother, runs swift for the open, brighteyed, seeking badger earth,
24165 under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground,
24166 sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrbling to be blooded. Ward
24167 Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six
24168 Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty
24169 sticks, hayforks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips,
24170 bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, greynegroes
24171 waving torches. The crowd bawls of dicers, crown and anchor players,
24172 thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high
24173 wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)_
24174 
24175 THE CROWD:
24176 
24177      Card of the races. Racing card!
24178      Ten to one the field!
24179      Tommy on the clay here! Tommy on the clay!
24180      Ten to one bar one! Ten to one bar one!
24181      Try your luck on Spinning Jenny!
24182      Ten to one bar one!
24183      Sell the monkey, boys! Sell the monkey!
24184      I'll give ten to one!
24185      Ten to one bar one!
24186 
24187 A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost,
24188 his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of
24189 bucking mounts. Skeleton horses, Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel,
24190 the Duke of Westminster's Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beaufort's
24191 Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rustyarmoured, leaping, leaping
24192 in their, in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain on a brokenwinded
24193 isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket,
24194 orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockeystick at
24195 the ready. His nag on spavined whitegaitered feet jogs along the rocky
24196 road.)_
24197 
24198 THE ORANGE LODGES: _(Jeering)_ Get down and push, mister. Last lap!
24199 You'll be home the night!
24200 
24201 GARRETT DEASY: _(Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with
24202 postagestamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the
24203 prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at schooling gallop)_
24204 
24205 Per vias rectas!_
24206 
24207 A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag a torrent
24208 of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips,
24209 potatoes.)_
24210 
24211 THE GREEN LODGES: Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!
24212 
24213 Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the
24214 windows, singing in discord.)_
24215 
24216 STEPHEN: Hark! Our friend noise in the street.
24217 
24218 ZOE: _(Holds up her hand)_ Stop!
24219 
24220 PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON AND CISSY CAFFREY:
24221 
24222 Yet I've a sort a Yorkshire relish for...
24223 
24224 ZOE: That's me. _(She claps her hands)_ Dance! Dance! _(She runs to the
24225 pianola)_ Who has twopence?
24226 
24227 BLOOM: Who'll...?
24228 
24229 LYNCH: _(Handing her coins)_ Here.
24230 
24231 STEPHEN: _(Cracking his fingers impatiently)_ Quick! Quick! Where's my
24232 augur's rod? _(He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his
24233 foot in tripudium)_
24234 
24235 ZOE: _(Turns the drumhandle)_ There.
24236 
24237 She drops two pennies in the slot. Gold, pink and violet lights
24238 start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor
24239 Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained
24240 inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the
24241 room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the pianostool and lifts
24242 and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsel's
24243 grace, his bowknot bobbing)_
24244 
24245 ZOE: _(Twirls round herself, heeltapping)_ Dance. Anybody here for
24246 there? Who'll dance? Clear the table.
24247 
24248 The pianola with changing lights plays in waltz time the prelude of_
24249 My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. _Stephen throws his ashplant on the table
24250 and seizes Zoe round the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards
24251 the fireplace. Stephen, arming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to
24252 waltz her round the room. Bloom stands aside. Her sleeve filling from
24253 gracing arms reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Between the
24254 curtains Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins
24255 a silk hat. With a deft kick he sends it spinning to his crown and
24256 jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk
24257 lapels, a gorget of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar
24258 with white kerchief, tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary
24259 gloves. In his buttonhole is an immense dahlia. He twirls in reversed
24260 directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places
24261 a hand lightly on his breastbone, bows, and fondles his flower and
24262 buttons.)_
24263 
24264 MAGINNI: The poetry of motion, art of calisthenics. No connection
24265 with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levenston's. Fancy dress balls arranged.
24266 Deportment. The Katty Lanner step. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean
24267 abilities. _(He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet) Tout
24268 le monde en avant! Rivirence! Tout le monde en place!_
24269 
24270 The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms shrivels,
24271 sinks, his live cape filling about the stool. The air in firmer waltz
24272 time sounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow,
24273 fide gold rosy violet.)_
24274 
24275 THE PIANOLA:
24276 
24277 Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls,
24278 Sweethearts they'd left behind...
24279 
24280 From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slimsandalled,
24281 in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance,
24282 twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold.
24283 Laughing, linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking
24284 mirrors, lifting their arms.)_
24285 
24286 MAGINNI: _(Clipclaps glovesilent hands) Carri! Avant deux!_ Breathe
24287 evenly! _Balance!_
24288 
24289 The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing
24290 to each other, shaping their curves, bowing visavis. Cavaliers behind
24291 them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching,
24292 rising from their shoulders.)_
24293 
24294 HOURS: You may touch my.
24295 
24296 CAVALIERS: May I touch your?
24297 
24298 HOURS: O, but lightly!
24299 
24300 CAVALIERS: O, so lightly!
24301 
24302 THE PIANOLA:
24303 
24304 My little shy little lass has a waist.
24305 
24306 Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours
24307 advance from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their
24308 cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey
24309 gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)_
24310 
24311 MAGINNI: _Avant huit! Traversi! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisi!_
24312 
24313 The night hours, one by one, steal to the last place. Morning, noon
24314 and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered
24315 hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary they curchycurchy under veils.)_
24316 
24317 THE BRACELETS: Heigho! Heigho!
24318 
24319 ZOE: _(Twirling, her hand to her brow)_ O!
24320 
24321 MAGINNI: _Les tiroirs! Channe de dames! La corbeille! Dos ` dos!_
24322 
24323 Arabesquing wearily they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving,
24324 unweaving, curtseying, twirling, simply swirling.)_
24325 
24326 ZOE: I'm giddy!
24327 
24328 She frees herself, droops on a chair. Stephen seizes Florry and turns
24329 with her.)_
24330 
24331 MAGINNI: Boulanghre! Les ronds! Les ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!
24332 
24333 Twining, receding, with interchanging hands the night hours link each
24334 each with arching arms in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn
24335 cumbrously.)_
24336 
24337 MAGINNI: _Dansez avec vos dames! Changez de dames! Donnez le petit
24338 bouquet ` votre dame! Remerciez!_
24339 
24340 THE PIANOLA:
24341 
24342      Best, best of all,
24343      Baraabum!
24344 
24345 KITTY: (JUMPS UP) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus
24346 bazaar!
24347 
24348 She runs to Stephen. He leaves florry brusquely and seizes Kitty.
24349 A screaming bittern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling
24350 Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the
24351 room.)_
24352 
24353 THE PIANOLA:

24355      My girl's a Yorkshire girl.
24356 
24357 ZOE:
24358 
24359 Yorkshire through and through.
24360 
24361 Come on all!
24362 
24363 She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)_
24364 
24365 STEPHEN: _Pas seul!_
24366 
24367 He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arms, snatches up his ashplant from
24368 the table and takes the floor. All wheel whirl waltz twirl. Bloombella

24400 
24401 The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes
24402 closed he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn
24403 roundabout. Bright midges dance on walls. He stops dead.)_
24404 
24405 STEPHEN: Ho!
24406 
24407 Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor, in leper
24408 grey with a wreath of faded orangeblossoms and a torn bridal veil, her
24409 face worn and noseless, green with gravemould. Her hair is scant and
24410 lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens
24411 her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and
24412 confessors sing voicelessly.)_
24413 
24414 THE CHOIR:
24415 
24416      Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
24417      Iubilantium te virginum...
24418 
24419 from the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress
24420 of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at
24421 her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)_
24422 
24423 BUCK MULLIGAN: She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the
24424 afflicted mother. _(He upturns his eyes)_ Mercurial Malachi!
24425 
24426 THE MOTHER: _(With the subtle smile of death's madness)_ I was once the
24427 beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.
24428 
24429 STEPHEN: _(Horrorstruck)_ Lemur, who are you? No. What bogeyman's trick
24430 is this?
24431 
24432 BUCK MULLIGAN: _(Shakes his curling capbell)_ The mockery of it! Kinch
24433 dogsbody killed her bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. _(Tears of molten
24434 butter fall from his eyes on to the scone)_ Our great sweet mother! _Epi
24435 oinopa ponton._
24436 
24437 THE MOTHER: _(Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of
24438 wetted ashes)_ All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in
24439 the world. You too. Time will come.
24440 
24441 STEPHEN: _(Choking with fright, remorse and horror)_ They say I killed
24442 you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.
24443 
24444 THE MOTHER: _(A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth)_
24445 You sang that song to me. _Love's bitter mystery._
24446 
24447 STEPHEN: _(Eagerly)_ Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word
24448 known to all men.
24449 
24450 THE MOTHER: Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at
24451 Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the
24452 strangers? Prayer is allpowerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the
24453 Ursuline manual and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.
24454 
24455 STEPHEN: The ghoul! Hyena!
24456 
24457 THE MOTHER: I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that
24458 boiled rice every night after your brainwork. Years and years I loved
24459 you, O, my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.
24460 
24461 ZOE: _(Fanning herself with the grate fan)_ I'm melting!
24462 
24463 FLORRY: _(Points to Stephen)_ Look! He's white.
24464 
24465 BLOOM: _(Goes to the window to open it more)_ Giddy.
24466 
24467 THE MOTHER: _(With smouldering eyes)_ Repent! O, the fire of hell!
24468 
24469 STEPHEN: _(Panting)_ His noncorrosive sublimate! The corpsechewer! Raw
24470 head and bloody bones.
24471 
24472 THE MOTHER: _(Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen
24473 breath)_ Beware! _(She raises her blackened withered right arm slowly
24474 towards Stephen's breast with outstretched finger)_ Beware God's hand!
24475 A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in
24476 Stephen's heart.)_
24477 
24478 STEPHEN: _(Strangled with rage)_ Shite! _(His features grow drawn grey
24479 and old)_
24480 
24481 BLOOM: _(At the window)_ What?
24482 
24483 STEPHEN: _Ah non, par exemple!_ The intellectual imagination! With me
24484 all or not at all. _Non serviam!_
24485 
24486 FLORRY: Give him some cold water. Wait. _(She rushes out)_
24487 
24488 THE MOTHER: _(Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately)_ O Sacred
24489 Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O Divine Sacred
24490 Heart!
24491 
24492 STEPHEN: No! No! No! Break my spirit, all of you, if you can! I'll bring
24493 you all to heel!
24494 
24495 THE MOTHER: _(In the agony of her deathrattle)_ Have mercy on Stephen,
24496 Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love,
24497 grief and agony on Mount Calvary.
24498 
24499 STEPHEN: _Nothung_!
24500 
24501 He lifts his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier.
24502 Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of
24503 all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)_
24504 
24505 THE GASJET: Pwfungg!
24506 
24507 BLOOM: Stop!
24508 
24509 LYNCH: _(Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand)_ Here! Hold on! Don't
24510 run amok!
24511 
24512 BELLA: Police!
24513 
24514 Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark,
24515 beats the ground and flies from the room, past the whores at the door.)_
24516 
24517 BELLA: _(Screams)_ After him!
24518 
24519 The two whores rush to the halldoor. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede
24520 from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)_
24521 
24522 THE WHORES: _(Jammed in the doorway, pointing)_ Down there.
24523 
24524 ZOE: _(Pointing)_ There. There's something up.
24525 
24526 BELLA: Who pays for the lamp? _(She seizes Bloom's coattail)_ Here, you
24527 were with him. The lamp's broken.
24528 
24529 BLOOM: _(Rushes to the hall, rushes back)_ What lamp, woman?
24530 
24531 A WHORE: He tore his coat.
24532 
24533 BELLA: _(Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points)_ Who's to pay
24534 for that? Ten shillings. You're a witness.
24535 
24536 BLOOM: _(Snatches up Stephen's ashplant)_ Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you
24537 lifted enough off him? Didn't he...?
24538 
24539 BELLA: _(Loudly)_ Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A
24540 ten shilling house.
24541 
24542 BLOOM: _(His head under the lamp, pulls the chain. Puling, the gasjet
24543 lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.)_ Only
24544 the chimney's broken. Here is all he...
24545 
24546 BELLA: _(Shrinks back and screams)_ Jesus! Don't!
24547 
24548 BLOOM: _(Warding off a blow)_ To show you how he hit the paper. There's
24549 not sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!
24550 
24551 FLORRY: _(With a glass of water, enters)_ Where is he?
24552 
24553 BELLA: Do you want me to call the police?
24554 
24555 BLOOM: O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student.
24556 Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. _(He makes
24557 a masonic sign)_ Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You
24558 don't want a scandal.
24559 
24560 BELLA: _(Angrily)_ Trinity. Coming down here ragging after the boatraces
24561 and paying nothing. Are you my commander here or? Where is he? I'll
24562 charge him! Disgrace him, I will! (She Shouts) Zoe! Zoe!
24563 
24564 BLOOM: _(Urgently)_ And if it were your own son in Oxford? _(Warningly)_
24565 I know.
24566 
24567 BELLA: _(Almost speechless)_ Who are. Incog!
24568 
24569 ZOE: _(In the doorway)_ There's a row on.
24570 
24571 BLOOM: What? Where? _(He throws a shilling on the table and starts)_
24572 That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air.
24573 
24574 He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows,
24575 spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores
24576 clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared
24577 off. From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front
24578 of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is
24579 about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts
24580 his face. Bella from within the hall urges on her whores. They blow
24581 ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly
24582 lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty
24583 still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood
24584 and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun
24585 al Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the
24586 railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn
24587 envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack
24588 of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in
24589 tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follow from fir, picking
24590 up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing
24591 their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks,
24592 runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel,
24593 cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, woman's
24594 slipperslappers. After him freshfound the hue and cry zigzag gallops

24621 
24622 At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting
24623 stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a
24624 jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)_
24625 
24626 STEPHEN: _(With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly)_ You
24627 are my guests. Uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh
24628 of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.
24629 
24630 PRIVATE CARR: _(To Cissy Caffrey)_ Was he insulting you?
24631 
24632 STEPHEN: Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter.
24633 Ungenitive.
24634 
24635 VOICES: No, he didn't. I seen him. The girl there. He was in Mrs
24636 Cohen's. What's up? Soldier and civilian.
24637 
24638 CISSY CAFFREY: I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to
24639 do--you know, and the young man run up behind me. But I'm faithful to
24640 the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.
24641 
24642 STEPHEN: _(Catches sight of Lynch's and Kitty's heads)_ Hail, Sisyphus.
24643 He points to himself and the others)_ Poetic. Uropoetic.
24644 
24645 VOICES: Shes faithfultheman.
24646 
24647 CISSY CAFFREY: Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.
24648 
24649 PRIVATE COMPTON: He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff
24650 him one, Harry.
24651 
24652 PRIVATE CARR: _(To Cissy)_ Was he insulting you while me and him was
24653 having a piss?
24654 
24655 LORD TENNYSON: _(Gentleman poet in Union Jack blazer and cricket
24656 flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded)_ Theirs not to reason why.
24657 
24658 PRIVATE COMPTON: Biff him, Harry.
24659 
24660 STEPHEN: _(To Private Compton)_ I don't know your name but you are quite
24661 right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their
24662 shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.
24663 
24664 CISSY CAFFREY: _(To The Crowd)_ No, I was with the privates.
24665 
24666 STEPHEN: _(Amiably)_ Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every
24667 lady for example...
24668 
24669 PRIVATE CARR: _(His cap awry, advances to Stephen)_ Say, how would it
24670 be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?
24671 
24672 STEPHEN: _(Looks up to the sky)_ How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of
24673 selfpretence. Personally, I detest action. _(He waves his hand)_ Hand
24674 hurts me slightly. _Enfin ce sont vos oignons._ _(To Cissy Caffrey)_
24675 Some trouble is on here. What is it precisely?
24676 
24677 DOLLY GRAY: _(From her balcony waves her handkerchief, giving the sign
24678 of the heroine of Jericho)_ Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to
24679 Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.
24680 
24681 The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)_
24682 
24683 BLOOM: _(Elbowing through the crowd, plucks Stephen's sleeve
24684 vigorously)_ Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.
24685 
24686 STEPHEN: _(Turns)_ Eh? _(He disengages himself)_ Why should I not speak
24687 to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange?
24688 He points his finger)_ I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see
24689 his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.
24690 
24691 He staggers a pace back)_
24692 
24693 BLOOM: _(Propping him)_ Retain your own.
24694 
24695 STEPHEN: _(Laughs emptily)_ My centre of gravity is displaced. I have
24696 forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle
24697 for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably the
24698 tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. _(He taps his
24699 brow)_ But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.
24700 
24701 BIDDY THE CLAP: Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor
24702 out of the college.
24703 
24704 CUNTY KATE: I did. I heard that.
24705 
24706 BIDDY THE CLAP: He expresses himself with such marked refinement of
24707 phraseology.
24708 
24709 CUNTY KATE: Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite
24710 trenchancy.
24711 
24712 PRIVATE CARR: _(Pulls himself free and comes forward)_ What's that
24713 you're saying about my king?
24714 
24715 Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wars a white jersey on
24716 which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched with the insignia of
24717 Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinner's
24718 and Probyn's horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable
24719 artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed
24720 as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron,
24721 marked_ made in Germany. _In his left hand he holds a plasterer's bucket
24722 on which is printed_ Difense d'uriner. _A roar of welcome greets him.)_
24723 
24724 EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly)_ Peace, perfect
24725 peace. For identification, bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. _(He turns
24726 to his subjects)_ We have come here to witness a clean straight fight
24727 and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a bak.
24728 
24729 He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and
24730 Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts his bucket graciously
24731 in acknowledgment.)_
24732 
24733 PRIVATE CARR: _(To Stephen)_ Say it again.
24734 
24735 STEPHEN: _(Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up)_ I understand your point
24736 of view though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of
24737 patent medicines. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the
24738 point. You die for your country. Suppose. _(He places his arm on Private
24739 Carr's sleeve)_ Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country
24740 die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I didn't want it to die.
24741 Damn death. Long live life!
24742 
24743 EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Levitates over heaps of slain, in the garb and
24744 with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent
24745 face)_
24746 
24747 My methods are new and are causing surprise. To make the blind see I
24748 throw dust in their eyes.
24749 
24750 STEPHEN: Kings and unicorns! _(He fills back a pace)_ Come somewhere and
24751 we'll... What was that girl saying?...
24752 
24753 PRIVATE COMPTON: Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one
24754 into Jerry.
24755 
24756 BLOOM: _(To the privates, softly)_ He doesn't know what he's saying.
24757 Taken a little more than is good for him. Absinthe. Greeneyed monster. I
24758 know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.
24759 
24760 STEPHEN: _(Nods, smiling and laughing)_ Gentleman, patriot, scholar and
24761 judge of impostors.
24762 
24763 PRIVATE CARR: I don't give a bugger who he is.
24764 
24765 PRIVATE COMPTON: We don't give a bugger who he is.
24766 
24767 STEPHEN: I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.
24768 
24769 Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day
24770 boy's hat signs to Stephen.)_
24771 
24772 KEVIN EGAN: H'lo! _Bonjour!_ The _vieille ogresse_ with the _dents
24773 jaunes_.
24774 
24775 Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbitface nibbling a quince
24776 leaf.)_
24777 
24778 PATRICE: _Socialiste!_
24779 
24780 DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY: _(In medieval hauberk,
24781 two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a
24782 mailed hand against the privates)_ Werf those eykes to footboden, big
24783 grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!
24784 
24785 BLOOM: _(To Stephen)_ Come home. You'll get into trouble.
24786 
24787 STEPHEN: _(Swaying)_ I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.
24788 
24789 BIDDY THE CLAP: One immediately observes that he is of patrician
24790 lineage.
24791 
24792 THE VIRAGO: Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.
24793 
24794 THE BAWD: The red's as good as the green. And better. Up the soldiers!
24795 Up King Edward!
24796 
24797 A ROUGH: _(Laughs)_ Ay! Hands up to De Wet.
24798 
24799 THE CITIZEN: _(With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls)_
24800 
24801      May the God above
24802      Send down a dove
24803      With teeth as sharp as razors
24804      To slit the throats
24805      Of the English dogs
24806      That hanged our Irish leaders.
24807 
24808 THE CROPPY BOY: _(The ropenoose round his neck, gripes in his issuing
24809 bowels with both hands)_
24810 
24811 I bear no hate to a living thing, But I love my country beyond the king.
24812 
24813 RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER: _(Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants,
24814 advances with gladstone bag which he opens)_ Ladies and gents,
24815 cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin
24816 dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the
24817 cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial
24818 containing arsenic retrieved from body of Miss Barron which sent Seddon
24819 to the gallows.
24820 
24821 He jerks the rope. The assistants leap at the victim's legs and drag
24822 him downward, grunting the croppy boy's tongue protrudes violently.)_
24823 
24824 THE CROPPY BOY:
24825 
24826 Horhot ho hray hor hother's hest.
24827 
24828 He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts
24829 of sperm spouting through his deathclothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs
24830 Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys
24831 rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)_
24832 
24833 RUMBOLD: I'm near it myself. _(He undoes the noose)_ Rope which hanged
24834 the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time. As applied to Her Royal Highness.
24835 He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out
24836 his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails)_ My painful
24837 duty has now been done. God save the king!
24838 
24839 EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket, and
24840 sings with soft contentment)_
24841 
24842 On coronation day, on coronation day, O, won't we have a merry time,
24843 Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
24844 
24845 PRIVATE CARR: Here. What are you saying about my king?
24846 
24847 STEPHEN: _(Throws up his hands)_ O, this is too monotonous! Nothing.
24848 He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for
24849 some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. _(He searches his pockets
24850 vaguely)_ GAVE IT TO SOMEONE.
24851 
24852 PRIVATE CARR: Who wants your bleeding money?
24853 
24854 STEPHEN: _(Tries to move off)_ Will someone tell me where I am least
24855 likely to meet these necessary evils? _Ga se voit aussi ` paris._ Not
24856 that I... But, by Saint Patrick...!
24857 
24858 The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears
24859 seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her
24860 breast.)_
24861 
24862 STEPHEN: Aha! I know you, gammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats
24863 her farrow!
24864 
24865 OLD GUMMY GRANNY: _(Rocking to and fro)_ Ireland's sweetheart, the king
24866 of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them!
24867 She keens with banshee woe)_ Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! _(She
24868 wails)_ You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?
24869 
24870 STEPHEN: How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of
24871 the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.
24872 
24873 CISSY CAFFREY: _(Shrill)_ Stop them from fighting!
24874 
24875 A ROUGH: Our men retreated.
24876 
24877 PRIVATE CARR: _(Tugging at his belt)_ I'll wring the neck of any fucker
24878 says a word against my fucking king.
24879 
24880 BLOOM: _(Terrified)_ He said nothing. Not a word. A pure
24881 misunderstanding.
24882 
24883 THE CITIZEN: _Erin go bragh!_
24884 
24885 Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals,
24886 decorations, trophies of war, wounds. Both salute with fierce
24887 hostility.)_
24888 
24889 PRIVATE COMPTON: Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.
24890 
24891 STEPHEN: Did I? When?
24892 
24893 BLOOM: _(To the redcoats)_ We fought for you in South Africa, Irish
24894 missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by
24895 our monarch.
24896 
24897 THE NAVVY: _(Staggering past)_ O, yes! O God, yes! O, make the kwawr a
24898 krowawr! O! Bo!
24899 
24900 Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted
24901 spearpoints. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in
24902 bearskin cap with hackleplume and accoutrements, with epaulettes, gilt
24903 chevrons and sabretaches, his breast bright with medals, toes the line.
24904 He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)_
24905 
24906 MAJOR TWEEDY: _(Growls gruffly)_ Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them!
24907 Mahar shalal hashbaz.
24908

24919 
24920 BIDDY THE CLAP: Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

24930 PRIVATE CARR: _(Loosening his belt, shouts)_ I'll wring the neck of any
24931 fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.
24932 
24933 BLOOM: _(Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders)_ Speak, you! Are you struck
24934 dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman,
24935 sacred lifegiver!
24936 
24937 CISSY CAFFREY: _(Alarmed, seizes Private Carr's sleeve)_ Amn't I with
24938 you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. _(She cries)_ Police!
24939 
24940 STEPHEN: _(Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey)_

24943      And thy quarrons dainty is.

24945 
24946 VOICES: Police!
24947 
24948 DISTANT VOICES: Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!
24949 
24950 Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns
24951 boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse
24952 commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech.
24953 Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on
24954 cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea,
24955 rising from marshlands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets,
24956 cormorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlins,
24957 blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The
24958 midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin
24959 from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black
24960 goatfell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless
24961 yawn. Tom Rochford, winner, in athlete's singlet and breeches, arrives
24962 at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void.
24963 He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they
24964 spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy
24965 clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their
24966 skirts above their heads to protect themselves. Laughing witches in red
24967 cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters
24968 blisters. It rains dragons' teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows.
24969 They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight
24970 duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith
24971 O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt,
24972 Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond,
24973 John O'Leary against Lear O'Johnny, Lord Edward Fitzgerald against Lord
24974 Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The
24975 O'Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the feldaltar
24976 of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns.
24977 From the high barbacans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the
24978 smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of
24979 unreason, lies, naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly.
24980 Father Malachi O'Flynn in a lace petticoat and reversed chasuble, his
24981 two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mass. The Reverend Mr
24982 Hugh C Haines Love M. A. in a plain cassock and mortarboard, his head
24983 and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrant's head an open
24984 umbrella.)_

24989 days.

24992 blooddripping host) Corpus meum._
24993 
24994 THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE: _(Raises high behind the celebrant's
24995 petticoat, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot
24996 is stuck)_ My body.

25017 windpipe!
25018 
25019 OLD GUMMY GRANNY: _(Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand)_ Remove
25020 him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be
25021 free. _(She prays)_ O good God, take him!
25022 
25023 THE RETRIEVER, NOSING ON THE FRINGE OF THE CROWD, BARKS NOISILY.)
25024 
25025 BLOOM: _(Runs to lynch)_ Can't you get him away?
25026 
25027 LYNCH: He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! _(To Bloom)_
25028 Get him away, you. He won't listen to me.
25029 
25030 He drags Kitty away.)_
25031 
25032 STEPHEN: _(Points) exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit._
25033 
25034 BLOOM: _(Runs to Stephen)_ Come along with me now before worse happens.
25035 Here's your stick.
25036 
25037 STEPHEN: Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.
25038 
25039 CISSY CAFFREY: _(Pulling Private Carr)_ Come on, you're boosed. He
25040 insulted me but I forgive him. _(Shouting in his ear)_ I forgive him for
25041 insulting me.
25042 
25043 BLOOM: _(Over Stephen's shoulder)_ Yes, go. You see he's incapable.
25044 
25045 PRIVATE CARR: _(Breaks loose)_ I'll insult him.
25046 
25047 He rushes towards Stephen, fist outstretched, and strikes him in the
25048 face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls, stunned. He lies prone, his
25049 face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it
25050 up.)_
25051 
25052 MAJOR TWEEDY: _(Loudly)_ Carbine in bucket! Cease fire! Salute!
25053 
25054 THE RETRIEVER: _(Barking furiously)_ Ute ute ute ute ute ute ute ute.
25055 
25056 THE CROWD: Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The
25057 soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him!
25058 He's fainted!
25059 
25060 A HAG: What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under
25061 the influence. Let them go and fight the Boers!
25062 
25063 THE BAWD: Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with
25064 his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

25066 They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit)_
25067 
25068 THE RETRIEVER: _(Barking)_ Wow wow wow.
25069 
25070 BLOOM: _(Shoves them back, loudly)_ Get back, stand back!
25071 
25072 PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Tugging his comrade)_ Here. Bugger off, Harry. Here's
25073 the cops! _(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group.)_
25074 
25075 FIRST WATCH: What's wrong here?
25076 
25077 PRIVATE COMPTON: We were with this lady. And he insulted us. And
25078 assaulted my chum. _(The retriever barks)_ Who owns the bleeding tyke?
25079 
25080 CISSY CAFFREY: _(With expectation)_ Is he bleeding!
25081 
25082 A MAN: _(Rising from his knees)_ No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.
25083 
25084 BLOOM: _(Glances sharply at the man)_ Leave him to me. I can easily...
25085 
25086 SECOND WATCH: Who are you? Do you know him?
25087 
25088 PRIVATE CARR: _(Lurches towards the watch)_ He insulted my lady friend.
25089 
25090 BLOOM: _(Angrily)_ You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness.
25091 Constable, take his regimental number.
25092 
25093 SECOND WATCH: I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my
25094 duty.
25095 
25096 PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Pulling his comrade)_ Here, bugger off Harry. Or
25097 Bennett'll shove you in the lockup.
25098 
25099 PRIVATE CARR: _(Staggering as he is pulled away)_ God fuck old Bennett.
25100 He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.
25101 
25102 FIRST WATCH: _(Takes out his notebook)_ What's his name?
25103 
25104 BLOOM: _(Peering over the crowd)_ I just see a car there. If you give me
25105 a hand a second, sergeant...
25106 
25107 FIRST WATCH: Name and address.
25108 
25109 Corny Kelleker, weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand,
25110 appears among the bystanders.)_
25111 
25112 BLOOM: _(Quickly)_ O, the very man! _(He whispers)_ Simon Dedalus' son.
25113 A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.
25114 
25115 SECOND WATCH: Night, Mr Kelleher.
25116 
25117 CORNY KELLEHER: _(To the watch, with drawling eye)_ That's all right.
25118 I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. _(He laughs)_
25119 Twenty to one. Do you follow me?
25120 
25121 FIRST WATCH: _(Turns to the crowd)_ Here, what are you all gaping at?
25122 Move on out of that.
25123 
25124 The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)_
25125 
25126 CORNY KELLEHER: Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. _(He
25127 laughs, shaking his head)_ We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse.
25128 What? Eh, what?
25129 
25130 FIRST WATCH: _(Laughs)_ I suppose so.
25131 
25132 CORNY KELLEHER: _(Nudges the second watch)_ Come and wipe your name off
25133 the slate. _(He lilts, wagging his head)_ With my tooraloom tooraloom
25134 tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?
25135 
25136 SECOND WATCH: _(Genially)_ Ah, sure we were too.
25137 
25138 CORNY KELLEHER: _(Winking)_ Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.
25139 
25140 SECOND WATCH: All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.
25141 
25142 CORNY KELLEHER: I'll see to that.
25143 
25144 BLOOM: _(Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn)_ Thank you very
25145 much, gentlemen. Thank you. _(He mumbles confidentially)_ We don't want
25146 any scandal, you understand. Father is a wellknown highly respected
25147 citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.
25148 
25149 FIRST WATCH: O. I understand, sir.
25150 
25151 SECOND WATCH: That's all right, sir.
25152 
25153 FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have to report
25154 it at the station.
25155 
25156 BLOOM: _(Nods rapidly)_ Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.
25157 
25158 SECOND WATCH: It's our duty.
25159 
25160 CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.
25161 
25162 THE WATCH: _(Saluting together)_ Night, gentlemen. _(They move off with
25163 slow heavy tread)_
25164 
25165 BLOOM: _(Blows)_ Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?...
25166 
25167 CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to
25168 the car brought up against the scaffolding)_ Two commercials that were
25169 standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two
25170 quid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the
25171 jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.
25172 
25173 BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...
25174 
25175 CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs)_ Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots.
25176 No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. _(He
25177 laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye)_ Thanks be to God we have it
25178 in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!
25179 
25180 BLOOM: _(Tries to laugh)_ He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just
25181 visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor
25182 fellow, he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and
25183 I was just making my way home...
25184 
25185 The horse neighs.)_
25186 
25187 THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
25188 
25189 CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after
25190 we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and
25191 got off to see. _(He laughs)_ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I
25192 give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?
25193 
25194 BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.
25195 
25196 Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls
25197 at the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)_
25198 
25199 CORNY KELLEHER: _(Scratches his nape)_ Sandycove! _(He bends down and
25200 calls to Stephen)_ Eh! _(He calls again)_ Eh! He's covered with shavings
25201 anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.
25202 
25203 BLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.
25204 
25205 CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll
25206 shove along. _(He laughs)_ I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the
25207 dead. Safe home!
25208 
25209 THE HORSE: _(Neighs)_ Hohohohohome.
25210 
25211 BLOOM: Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...
25212 
25213 Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse
25214 harness jingles.)_
25215 
25216 CORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing)_ Night.
25217 
25218 BLOOM: Night.
25219 
25220 The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The
25221 car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. Corny Kelleher on the
25222 sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom's plight.
25223 The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the
25224 farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb
25225 and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the
25226 sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom
25227 conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car
25228 jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher
25229 again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny
25230 Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling
25231 harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. Bloom, holding
25232 in his hand Stephen's hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands
25233 irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)_
25234 
25235 BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _(There is no answer; he bends again)_ Mr Dedalus!
25236 There is no answer)_ The name if you call. Somnambulist. _(He bends
25237 again and hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate
25238 form)_ Stephen! _(There is no answer. He calls again.)_ Stephen!
25239 
25240 STEPHEN: _(Groans)_ Who? Black panther. Vampire. _(He sighs and
25241 stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels)_
25242 
25243      Who... drive... Fergus now
25244      And pierce... wood's woven shade?...
25245 
25246 He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)_
25247 
25248 BLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. _(He bends again and undoes
25249 the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat)_ To breathe. _(He brushes the
25250 woodshavings from Stephen's clothes with light hand and fingers)_ One
25251 pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. _(He listens)_ What?
25252 
25253 STEPHEN: _(Murmurs)_
25254 
25255     ... shadows... the woods
25256     ... white breast... dim sea.
25257 
25258 He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom,
25259 holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the distance.
25260 Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on
25261 Stephen's face and form.)_
25262 
25263 BLOOM: _(Communes with the night)_ Face reminds me of his poor mother.
25264 In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A
25265 girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him. _(He murmurs)_... swear
25266 that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts,
25267 art or arts... _(He murmurs)_... in the rough sands of the sea... a
25268 cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs... and flows
25269 
25270 
25271 Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips
25272 in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears
25273 slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an
25274 eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book
25275 in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the
25276 page.)_
25277 
25278 BLOOM: _(Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly)_ Rudy!
25279 
25280 RUDY: _(Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing,
25281 smiling. He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has diamond and
25282 ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a
25283 violet bowknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)_
25284 
25285 
25286 
25287 
25288  III --
25289 
25290 Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of
25291 the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
25292 generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His
25293 Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit
25294 unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr
25295 Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water
25296 available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an
25297 expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's
25298 shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge
25299 where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and
25300 soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he
25301 was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him
25302 to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means
25303 during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was
25304 rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable
25305 to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their
25306 then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always
25307 assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a
25308 few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten
25309 to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman
25310 service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver
25311 street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier's and the
25312 distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of
25313 Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence
25314 debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But
25315 as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for
25316 hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some
25317 fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was
25318 no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
25319 anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting
25320 a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
25321 
25322 This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
25323 there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it
25324 which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett's and the
25325 Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
25326 direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped
25327 by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
25328 to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,
25329 entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
25330 light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed
25331 for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
25332 cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered
25333 along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a
25334 jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer
25335 happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _`
25336 propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little
25337 while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway
25338 station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was
25339 suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue
25340 a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more
25341 especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course
25342 turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.
25343 Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford
25344 place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's the
25345 stonecutter's in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the
25346 right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled
25347 with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery,
25348 situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed
25349 of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and
25350 most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me
25351 where is fancy bread, at Rourke's the baker's it is said.
25352 
25353 En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not
25354 yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete
25355 possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,
25356 spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame
25357 and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not
25358 as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for
25359 young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking
25360 habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu
25361 for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could
25362 administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential
25363 was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was
25364 blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the
25365 eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a
25366 candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and
25367 an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the
25368 solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply
25369 spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned
25370 the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked,
25371 were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr
25372 Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil
25373 street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on
25374 the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for
25375 example, the
25376 
25377 guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being
25378 they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented
25379 on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description
25380 liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them
25381 against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything. You
25382 frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and
25383 also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women
25384 of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of l s. d. into the bargain and
25385 the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching
25386 the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old
25387 wine in season as both
25388 
25389 nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a
25390 good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond
25391 a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to
25392 trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of
25393 others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion
25394 of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confreres_ but one, a most glaring
25395 piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.
25396 
25397 And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
25398 whatsoever of any kind.
25399 
25400 Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back
25401 of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier
25402 of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted
25403 their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for
25404 no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by
25405 the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker
25406 figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He
25407 began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having
25408 happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered
25409 that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's,
25410 Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway
25411 bridge.
25412 
25413 Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.
25414 
25415 A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches
25416 saluted again, calling:
25417 
25418 Night!_
25419 
25420 Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
25421 compliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch
25422 as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but
25423 nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety
25424 though not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he
25425 knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next
25426 to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising
25427 peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some
25428 secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the
25429 Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply
25430 marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell
25431 swoop at a moment's notice, your money or your life, leaving you there
25432 to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.
25433 
25434 Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,
25435 though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley's
25436 breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him
25437 and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of
25438 inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married
25439 a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His
25440 grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow
25441 of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.
25442 Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of
25443 the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably
25444 fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or
25445 some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed
25446 the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This therefore
25447 was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute
25448 man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious
25449 proclivities as Lord John Corley.
25450 
25451 Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.
25452 Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends
25453 had all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called
25454 him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other
25455 uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to
25456 tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all,
25457 to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that
25458 was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected
25459 through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same
25460 time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to
25461 finish. Anyhow he was all in.
25462 
25463 I wouldn't ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows
25464 I'm on the rocks.
25465 
25466 There'll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys'
25467 school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You
25468 may mention my name.
25469 
25470 Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was
25471 never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck
25472 twice in the junior at the christian brothers.
25473 
25474 I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.
25475 
25476 Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to
25477 do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody
25478 tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs
25479 Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
25480 M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over
25481 in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person
25482 addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he
25483 hadn't said a word about it.
25484 
25485 Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it
25486 still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew
25487 that Corley's brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly
25488 deserving of much credence. However _haud ignarus malorum miseris
25489 succurrere disco_ etcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck
25490 would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on
25491 the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though
25492 a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke
25493 was nothing would get it out of Corley's head that he was living in
25494 affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful. Whereas.
25495 He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food
25496 there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu
25497 so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but
25498 the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash
25499 missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.
25500 He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost
25501 as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a
25502 pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. He was altogether too
25503 fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.
25504 About biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them he
25505 wondered or where was or did he buy. However in another pocket he came
25506 across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however,
25507 as it turned out.
25508 
25509 Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.
25510 
25511 And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him
25512 one of them.
25513 
25514 Thanks, Corley answered, you're a gentleman. I'll pay you back one
25515 time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse
25516 in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good
25517 word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only
25518 the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks,
25519 man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl
25520 Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a
25521 crossing sweeper.
25522 
25523 Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
25524 he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky
25525 that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's,
25526 bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara
25527 and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he was lagged
25528 the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and
25529 refusing to go with the constable.
25530 
25531 210
25532 
25533 Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
25534 cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
25535 watchman's sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
25536 was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
25537 private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time
25538 now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor
25539 as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was
25540 not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.
25541 Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in
25542 point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated
25543 hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic
25544 impecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the
25545 matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor
25546 neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for
25547 the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock
25548 himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be
25549 a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of
25550 cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.
25551 Pretty thick that was certainly.
25552 
25553 The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his
25554 practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
25555 blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,
25556 laughingly, Stephen, that is:
25557 
25558 He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
25559 Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.
25560 
25561 At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
25562 Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
25563 direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,
25564 moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
25565 whereupon he observed evasively:
25566 
25567 Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it
25568 his face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much
25569 did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?
25570 
25571 Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep
25572 somewhere.
25573 
25574 Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at
25575 the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he
25576 invariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according
25577 to his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he with
25578 a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of
25579 the question. And even supposing you did you won't get in after what
25580 occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I
25581 don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why
25582 did you leave your father's house?
25583 
25584 To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.
25585 
25586 I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
25587 diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
25588 yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of
25589 conversation that he had moved.
25590 
25591 I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.
25592 Why?
25593 
25594 A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects
25595 than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one. He takes great
25596 pride, quite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he
25597 hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row
25598 terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,
25599 that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred
25600 their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally
25601 station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,
25602 which they did.
25603 
25604 There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
25605 was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
25606 family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by
25607 the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
25608 cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
25609 could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings
25610 they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and
25611 Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
25612 and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in
25613 accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain
25614 on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or
25615 something like that.
25616 
25617 No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust
25618 in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr
25619 Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. He
25620 knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he
25621 never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you
25622 didn't notice as much as I did. But it wouldn't occasion me the least
25623 surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in
25624 your drink for some ulterior object.
25625 
25626 He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile
25627 allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly
25628 coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade
25629 fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as
25630 a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
25631 in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
25632 certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first
25633 aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
25634 exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
25635 frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
25636 at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy,
25637 pure and simple.
25638 
25639 Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
25640 your brains, he ventured to throw out.
25641 
25642 The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
25643 friendliness which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression
25644 of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
25645 problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by
25646 two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw
25647 through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself
25648 allowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect
25649 and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he
25650 possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.
25651 
25652 Adjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car round
25653 which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting
25654 rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly
25655 animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.
25656 
25657 Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!_
25658 
25659 Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano piu..._
25660 
25661 Dice lui, pero!_
25662 
25663 Mezzo._
25664 
25665 Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_
25666 
25667 Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa piu..._
25668 
25669 Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious
25670 wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been
25671 before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few
25672 hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat
25673 Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual
25674 facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few
25675 moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner
25676 only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection
25677 of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_
25678 already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation
25679 for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.
25680 
25681 Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest
25682 to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
25683 shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.
25684 
25685 Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order
25686 these commodities quietly. The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores
25687 or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
25688 apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual
25689 portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for
25690 some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the
25691 floor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having
25692 just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be
25693 sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protigi_ in
25694 an audible tone of voice _a propos_ of the battle royal in the street
25695 which was still raging fast and furious:
25696 
25697 A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not
25698 write your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious
25699 and full. _Belladonna. Voglio._
25700 
25701 Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering
25702 from lassitude generally, replied:
25703 
25704 To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.
25705 
25706 Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
25707 inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
25708 absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds
25709 it.
25710 
25711 The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tjte-b-tjte_ put a
25712 boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table
25713 and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After
25714 which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have
25715 a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For which
25716 reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did
25717 the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily
25718 supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.
25719 
25720 Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
25721 like names. Cicero, Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.
25722 Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?
25723 
25724 Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name
25725 was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.
25726 
25727 The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
25728 Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
25729 by asking:
25730 
25731 And what might your name be?
25732 
25733 Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but
25734 Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
25735 quarter, answered:
25736 
25737 Dedalus.
25738 
25739 The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
25740 rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
25741 Hollands and water.
25742 
25743 You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.
25744 
25745 I've heard of him, Stephen said.
25746 
25747 Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
25748 eavesdropping too.
25749 
25750 He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
25751 way and nodding. All Irish.
25752 
25753 All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.
25754 
25755 As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business
25756 and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor
25757 of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the
25758 remark:
25759 
25760 I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
25761 shoulder. The lefthand dead shot.
25762 
25763 Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his
25764 gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.
25765 
25766 Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.
25767 Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.
25768 
25769 He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then he
25770 screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night
25771 with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.
25772 
25773 Pom! he then shouted once.
25774 
25775 The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there
25776 being still a further egg.
25777 
25778 Pom! he shouted twice.
25779 
25780 Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding
25781 bloodthirstily:
25782 
25783 Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never will._
25784 
25785 A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like
25786 asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the
25787 Bisley.
25788 
25789 Beg pardon, the sailor said.
25790 
25791 Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.
25792 
25793 Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
25794 influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He
25795 toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in
25796 Stockholm.
25797 
25798 Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.
25799 
25800 Murphy's my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.
25801 Know where that is?
25802 
25803 Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.
25804 
25805 That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's
25806 where I hails from. I belongs there. That's where I hails from. My
25807 little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. _For England,
25808 home and beauty_. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years
25809 now, sailing about.
25810 
25811 Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming
25812 to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones,
25813 a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a
25814 number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
25815 Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc
25816 O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of
25817 poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.
25818 Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the
25819 absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he
25820 finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent
25821 his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but
25822 I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow,
25823 at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the
25824 deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the
25825 publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and
25826 onions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on
25827 her knee, _post mortem_ child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my
25828 galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I
25829 remain with much love your brokenhearted husband D B Murphy.
25830 
25831 The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one
25832 of the jarvies with the request:
25833 
25834 You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?
25835 
25836 The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of
25837 plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was
25838 passed from hand to hand.
25839 
25840 Thank you, the sailor said.
25841 
25842 He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow
25843 stammers, proceeded:
25844 
25845 We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster _Rosevean_
25846 from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this
25847 afternoon. There's my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.
25848 
25849 In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket
25850 and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.
25851 
25852 You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,
25853 leaning on the counter.
25854 
25855 Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated
25856 a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and
25857 North America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage.
25858 I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,
25859 the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever
25860 scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. _Gospodi pomilyou_. That's how the
25861 Russians prays.
25862 
25863 You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.
25864 
25865 Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen
25866 queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an
25867 anchor same as I chew that quid.
25868 
25869 He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his
25870 teeth, bit ferociously:
25871 
25872 Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and
25873 the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent
25874 me.
25875 
25876 He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to
25877 be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The
25878 printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia._
25879 
25880 All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
25881 women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
25882 sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
25883 them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.
25884 
25885 Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs
25886 like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more
25887 children.
25888 
25889 See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver
25890 raw.
25891 
25892 His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for
25893 several minutes if not more.
25894 
25895 Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.
25896 
25897 Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:
25898 
25899 Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.
25900 
25901 Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the
25902 card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran
25903 as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Seqor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,
25904 Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.
25905 Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the
25906 eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the
25907 Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which
25908 occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat) having
25909 detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person
25910 he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours
25911 after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and
25912 the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some
25913 suspicions of our friend's _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in
25914 a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday
25915 or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had
25916 ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a
25917 born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained
25918 a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.
25919 Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but
25920 some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that
25921 the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking
25922 down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not so dear, purse
25923 permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to
25924 Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.
25925 The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in
25926 every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was
25927 out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,
25928 Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of
25929 the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon
25930 where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey,
25931 wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just
25932 struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around
25933 on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert
25934 tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts,
25935 Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne,
25936 Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel
25937 islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.
25938 Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies
25939 on the job, witness Mrs C P M'Coy type lend me your valise and I'll post
25940 you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the
25941 Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading
25942 lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners,
25943 perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing
25944 puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of
25945 bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business
25946 with pleasure. But who? That was the rub. Also, without being actually
25947 positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line
25948 of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the
25949 Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the
25950 tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red
25951 tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A
25952 great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet
25953 the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e.
25954 Brown, Robinson and Co.
25955 
25956 It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no
25957 small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the
25958 system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry
25959 pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead
25960 of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me
25961 for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum
25962 months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind
25963 of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her
25964 spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.
25965 There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home
25966 island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora
25967 of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around
25968 Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was
25969 a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow,
25970 rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly
25971 wheelmen so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of Donegal
25972 where if report spoke true the _coup d'oeil_ was exceedingly grand
25973 though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the
25974 influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the
25975 signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic
25976 associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV,
25977 rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt
25978 with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young
25979 men's fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the
25980 cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left
25981 leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the
25982 pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely
25983 in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be
25984 desired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of
25985 curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created
25986 the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the
25987 other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.
25988 
25989 I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had
25990 little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and
25991 every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house,
25992 another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added,
25993 the chinks does.
25994 
25995 Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
25996 globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.
25997 
25998 And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his
25999 back. Knife like that.
26000 
26001 Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in
26002 keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.
26003 
26004 In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.
26005 Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. _Prepare to
26006 meet your God_, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.
26007 
26008 His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further
26009 questions even should they by any chance want to.
26010 
26011 That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable
26012 stiletto_.
26013 
26014 After which harrowing _denouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he
26015 snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in
26016 his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.
26017 
26018 They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in
26019 the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought
26020 the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of
26021 them using knives.
26022 
26023 At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance
26024 is bliss_ Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
26025 instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the
26026 strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,
26027 alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid
26028 from his boiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work
26029 of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed
26030 the impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on.
26031 Funny, very!
26032 
26033 There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and
26034 starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
26035 natives _choza de_, another the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so far
26036 as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He
26037 vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well
26038 as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the
26039 land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively
26040 speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was
26041 just turned fifteen.
26042 
26043 Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.
26044 
26045 The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.
26046 
26047 Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.
26048 
26049 The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or
26050 no.
26051 
26052 Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he
26053 had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but
26054 he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust,
26055 and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.
26056 
26057 What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the
26058 boats?
26059 
26060 Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before
26061 answering:
26062 
26063 I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.
26064 Salt junk all the time.
26065 
26066 Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not
26067 likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,
26068 fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the
26069 globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,
26070 it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
26071 what it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen
26072 at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a
26073 superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the
26074 not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at
26075 it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone
26076 somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to
26077 find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes
26078 and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under,
26079 tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no
26080 secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_
26081 of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in
26082 all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had
26083 to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went
26084 to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the
26085 other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were
26086 run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no
26087 other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the
26088 public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case
26089 might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its
26090 gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had
26091 to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the
26092 season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and
26093 sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the
26094 Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding
26095 which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy,
26096 not to say stormy, weather.
26097 
26098 There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog,
26099 himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
26100 gentleman's valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on
26101 me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job,
26102 shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny,
26103 run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where
26104 he could be drawing easy money.
26105 
26106 What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the
26107 side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
26108 from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy
26109 getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.
26110 
26111 Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?
26112 He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.
26113 
26114 The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow
26115 shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to
26116 be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an
26117 anchor.
26118 
26119 There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.
26120 I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects
26121 to. I hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.
26122 
26123 Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged
26124 his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the
26125 mariner's hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
26126 young man's sideface looking frowningly rather.
26127 
26128 Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were Iying
26129 becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the
26130 name of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.
26131 
26132 Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.
26133 
26134 That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.
26135 Someway in his. Squeezing or.
26136 
26137 See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And
26138 there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his
26139 fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.
26140 
26141 And in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did
26142 actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the
26143 unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this
26144 time stretched over.
26145 
26146 Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone
26147 too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.
26148 
26149 He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression
26150 of before.
26151 
26152 Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.
26153 
26154 And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.
26155 
26156 Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.
26157 
26158 Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this
26159 time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the
26160 direction of the questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.
26161 
26162 And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged
26163 end:
26164 
26165 As bad as old Antonio, For he left me on my ownio._
26166 
26167 The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat
26168 peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on
26169 her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr
26170 Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment
26171 flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink
26172 sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had
26173 laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though
26174 why pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment
26175 round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that
26176 afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the
26177 lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)
26178 and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed
26179 rather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to
26180 admit he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles
26181 street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled
26182 with Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really
26183 loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still just
26184 then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her
26185 company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude
26186 sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he
26187 just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door
26188 with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all
26189 there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper
26190 Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her.
26191 
26192 The gunboat, the keeper said.
26193 
26194 It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,
26195 how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
26196 disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober
26197 senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of
26198 course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.
26199 Still no matter what the cause is from...
26200 
26201 Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely
26202 remarking:
26203 
26204 In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a
26205 roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
26206 buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.
26207 
26208 The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,
26209 said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a
26210 stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from
26211 any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere
26212 not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing,
26213 he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart
26214 advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of
26215 the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a
26216 lasting boon on everybody concerned.
26217 
26218 You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe
26219 in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,
26220 as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I
26221 believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as
26222 the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such
26223 inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?
26224 
26225 Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
26226 and concentrate and remember before he could say:
26227 
26228 They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and
26229 therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the
26230 possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I
26231 can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
26232 practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both
26233 being excluded by court etiquette.
26234 
26235 Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
26236 mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still
26237 he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly
26238 rejoining:
26239 
26240 Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant
26241 you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a
26242 blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
26243 instance to invent those rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison,
26244 though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,
26245 and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural
26246 phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour
26247 to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.
26248 
26249 O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several
26250 of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial
26251 evidence.
26252 
26253 On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
26254 were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in
26255 their respective ages, clashed.
26256 
26257 Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his
26258 original point with a smile of unbelief. I'm not so sure about that.
26259 That's a matter for everyman's opinion and, without dragging in the
26260 sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_
26261 there. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were
26262 genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the
26263 big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them
26264 like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely
26265 better than I, of course I needn't tell you. Can't you drink that
26266 coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It's
26267 like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what
26268 he hasn't got. Try a bit.
26269 
26270 Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the
26271 moment refusing to dictate further.
26272 
26273 Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir
26274 or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something
26275 approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and
26276 lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or
26277 nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in
26278 run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings
26279 and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower
26280 orders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection
26281 they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently
26282 associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for
26283 her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was
26284 to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak
26285 of. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he
26286 remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't
26287 remember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection,
26288 of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly
26289 accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of the
26290 medical analysis involved.
26291 
26292 Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being
26293 stirred.
26294 
26295 Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug
26296 from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and
26297 took a sip of the offending beverage.
26298 
26299 Still it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid
26300 food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but
26301 regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental
26302 or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different
26303 man.
26304 
26305 Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that
26306 knife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.
26307 
26308 Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,
26309 a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or
26310 antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least
26311 conspicuous point about it.
26312 
26313 Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of
26314 knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. Do you think they are
26315 genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and
26316 lie like old boots. Look at him.
26317 
26318 Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was
26319 full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it
26320 was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an
26321 entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent
26322 probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly
26323 accurate gospel.
26324 
26325 He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
26326 Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a
26327 wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
26328 there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail
26329 delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate
26330 such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He
26331 might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,
26332 as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself
26333 and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say
26334 nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage
26335 of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who
26336 expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the
26337 other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because
26338 meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting
26339 news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean
26340 seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.
26341 And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself
26342 couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers
26343 other fellows coined about him.
26344 
26345 Mind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed.
26346 Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,
26347 though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the
26348 midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some
26349 Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn't straighten
26350 their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he
26351 proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews
26352 or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly
26353 powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as
26354 gods. There's an example again of simple souls.
26355 
26356 However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
26357 reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied
26358 the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the
26359 management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host
26360 of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him
26361 though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually
26362 fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically
26363 incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the
26364 back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he
26365 was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish
26366 way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little
26367 Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows
26368 except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary
26369 animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good
26370 old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on
26371 the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.
26372 
26373 Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like
26374 that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own
26375 hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they
26376 carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.
26377 My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could
26378 actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in
26379 technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite
26380 dark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate
26381 accounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry
26382 in Italian.
26383 
26384 The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very
26385 passionate about ten shillings. _Roberto ruba roba sua_.
26386 
26387 Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.
26388 
26389 Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown
26390 listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles
26391 triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san
26392 Tommaso Mastino.
26393 
26394 It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the
26395 blood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare
26396 street museum 890 today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call
26397 it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid
26398 proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of
26399 women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way
26400 you find but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides they
26401 have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a
26402 woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it
26403 may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it's a thing I simply
26404 hate to see.
26405 
26406 Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
26407 others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,
26408 goo collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course
26409 had his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and
26410 weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all
26411 those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him
26412 or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.
26413 
26414 So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt's rock, wreck
26415 of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for
26416 the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell
26417 remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the
26418 town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original
26419 verse of 910 distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_),
26420 breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in
26421 commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about the
26422 case of the s. s. _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which
26423 was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all
26424 hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the _Mona's_, said he
26425 was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it
26426 appears, in her hold.
26427 
26428 At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him
26429 to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.
26430 
26431 Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just
26432 gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.
26433 
26434 He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
26435 stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore
26436 due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who
26437 noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's
26438 rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his
26439 burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and,
26440 applying its nozz1e to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of
26441 it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a
26442 shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the
26443 counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared
26444 to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when
26445 duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and
26446 girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all
26447 radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person
26448 or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the
26449 cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief
26450 space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently
26451 giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his
26452 bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where
26453 it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for
26454 new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his
26455 sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation
26456 stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other
26457 in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the
26458 parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human
26459 probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about
26460 and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms
26461 of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent
26462 form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent
26463 home comforts all his life who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year
26464 at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make
26465 general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether
26466 after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly
26467 stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a
26468 moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if--a
26469 big if, however--he had contrived to cure himself of his particular
26470 partiality.
26471 
26472 All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
26473 coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same
26474 thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin,
26475 the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no
26476 ships ever called.
26477 
26478 There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au
26479 fait_.
26480 
26481 What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only
26482 rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr
26483 Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised
26484 them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day's
26485 work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.
26486 
26487 Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his
26488 private potation and the rest of his exertions.
26489 
26490 That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words
26491 growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other
26492 in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate
26493 the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the
26494 time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs
26495 and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in
26496 he rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an
26497 atmosphere of drink into the _soirie_, boisterously trolling, like a
26498 veritable son of a seacook:
26499 
26500      _--The biscuits was as hard as brass
26501      And the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.
26502      O, Johnny Lever!
26503      Johnny Lever, O!_
26504 
26505 After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene
26506 and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form
26507 provided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to
26508 grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent
26509 the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he
26510 described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on
26511 the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in
26512 large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year,
26513 ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of
26514 it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the
26515 nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more
26516 surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became
26517 general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal
26518 thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down
26519 there in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like
26520 of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no
26521 uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in
26522 store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her
26523 crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.
26524 The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he
26525 affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was
26526 toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel,
26527 which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the
26528 Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped
26529 their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His
26530 advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work
26531 for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare
26532 a single one of her sons.
26533 
26534 Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_. The impervious
26535 navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.
26536 
26537 Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a
26538 bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.
26539 
26540 To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper
26541 concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.
26542 
26543 Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately
26544 interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and
26545 generals we've got? Tell me that.
26546 
26547 The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial
26548 blemishes apart.
26549 
26550 That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic
26551 peasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?
26552 
26553 While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added
26554 he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman
26555 worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few
26556 irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing
26557 to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long
26558 as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows.
26559 
26560 From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was
26561 rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,
26562 pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was
26563 fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,
26564 unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather
26565 concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with
26566 the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years
26567 the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as
26568 time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could
26569 personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies,
26570 equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly
26571 advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even
26572 though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of
26573 whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish
26574 soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in
26575 fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee
26576 of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous
26577 invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as
26578 being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was
26579 prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything,
26580 the others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper,
26581 who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (B.) couldn't help
26582 feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the
26583 goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have
26584 anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their
26585 felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming
26586 forward and turning queen's evidence or king's now like Denis or Peter
26587 Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that he disliked
26588 those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such
26589 criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any
26590 shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly
26591 remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who
26592 had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his
26593 political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to
26594 any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south,
26595 have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words
26596 passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky
26597 mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on
26598 his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_
26599 by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that
26600 Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual
26601 perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed,
26602 actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some
26603 legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient
26604 history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he
26605 had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died
26606 naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell
26607 positively last performance then come up smiling again. Generous to a
26608 fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort,
26609 always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very
26610 shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some l s d. in the
26611 course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere
26612 of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for
26613 the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he
26614 told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.
26615 
26616 He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
26617 whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and
26618 in a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts
26619 in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his
26620 family like me though in reality I'm not. That was one for him. A soft
26621 answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone
26622 saw. Am I not right?
26623 
26624 He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride
26625 at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
26626 glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly.
26627 
26628 Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or
26629 four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any
26630 other, _secundum carnem_.
26631 
26632 Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides
26633 of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to
26634 right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is
26635 though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the
26636 government it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all
26637 very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.
26638 I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It never
26639 reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due
26640 instalments plan. It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate
26641 people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,
26642 in the next house so to speak.
26643 
26644 Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen
26645 assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.
26646 
26647 Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that
26648 was overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of
26649 thing.
26650 
26651 You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of
26652 conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely...
26653 
26654 All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up
26655 bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,
26656 erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were
26657 very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of
26658 everything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.
26659 
26660 They accuse, remarked he audibly.
26661 
26662 He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as
26663 the others in case they.
26664 
26665 Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of
26666 ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would
26667 you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the
26668 inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,
26669 an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,
26670 imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They
26671 are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to indulge in any
26672 because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as
26673 you are. But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest
26674 spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead
26675 America. Turks. It's in the dogma. Because if they didn't believe they'd
26676 go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better, at least
26677 so I think. That's the juggle on which the p.p's raise the wind on false
26678 pretences. I'm, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman
26679 as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see
26680 everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a
26681 comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something
26682 in the neighbourhood of 300 pounds per annum. That's the vital issue
26683 at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier
26684 intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for what it's
26685 worth. I call that patriotism. _Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering
26686 of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_. Where you can live
26687 well, the sense is, if you work.
26688 
26689 Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
26690 synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.
26691 He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
26692 crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours
26693 of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere
26694 beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
26695 didn't say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.
26696 
26697 Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.
26698 
26699 The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person
26700 who owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all
26701 must work, have to, together.
26702 
26703 I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest
26704 possible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of
26705 the thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel
26706 nowadays. That's work too. Important work. After all, from the little
26707 I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are
26708 entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit
26709 as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the
26710 peasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.
26711 Each is equally important.
26712 
26713 You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may
26714 be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called
26715 Ireland for short.
26716 
26717 I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.
26718 
26719 But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important
26720 because it belongs to me.
26721 
26722 What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under
26723 some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the
26724 latter portion. What was it you...?
26725 
26726 Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
26727 coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: 1170
26728 
26729 We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.
26730 
26731 At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked
26732 down but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction
26733 to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some
26734 kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of
26735 his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way
26736 foreign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached
26737 the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn't
26738 been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear
26739 for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air
26740 of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,
26741 the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,
26742 failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind
26743 instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the
26744 bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance
26745 there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist,
26746 respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries
26747 among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance
26748 to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in
26749 public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual _denouement_
26750 after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got 1190 landed into hot
26751 water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint
26752 to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to
26753 be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act,
26754 certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged
26755 for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly,
26756 putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a
26757 deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo
26758 which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house
26759 of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir
26760 apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages
26761 simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected
26762 about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to
26763 morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their
26764 veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy,
26765 as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they
26766 thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were
26767 always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of
26768 dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing
26769 should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider
26770 between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of
26771 impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her,
26772 mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety
26773 degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the
26774 original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way
26775 to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer
26776 force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.
26777 
26778 For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even
26779 to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could
26780 not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the
26781 bad having in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the
26782 acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food
26783 for reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation,
26784 as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.
26785 Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row,
26786 old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the
26787 whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the
26788 world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.
26789 coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope
26790 lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet
26791 with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken
26792 down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common
26793 groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per
26794 column. _My Experiences_, let us say, _in a Cabman's Shelter_.
26795 
26796 The pink edition extra sporting of the _Telegraph_ tell a graphic lie
26797 lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling
26798 again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the
26799 preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was
26800 addressed A. Boudin find the captain's age, his eyes went aimlessly
26801 over the respective captions which came under his special province the
26802 allembracing give us this day our daily press. First he got a bit of a
26803 start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H.
26804 du Boyes, agent for typewriters or something like that. Great battle,
26805 Tokio. Lovemaking in Irish, 200 pounds damages. Gordon Bennett.
26806 Emigration Swindle. Letter from His Grace. William. Ascot meeting,
26807 the Gold Cup. Victory of outsider _Throwaway_ recalls Derby of '92 when
26808 Capt. Marshall's dark horse _Sir Hugo_ captured the blue ribband at long
26809 odds. New York disaster. Thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral of
26810 the late Mr Patrick Dignam.
26811 
26812 So to change the subject he read about Dignam R. I. P. which, he
26813 reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address
26814 anyway.
26815 
26816 This morning_ (Hynes put it in of course) _the remains of the late Mr
26817 Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue,
26818 Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a
26819 most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a
26820 brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom
26821 he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the
26822 deceased were present, were carried out_ (certainly Hynes wrote it with
26823 a nudge from Corny) _by Messrs H. J. O'Neill and Son, 164 North Strand
26824 Road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan
26825 brother-in-law), Jno. Henry Menton, solr, Martin Cunningham, John
26826 Power, eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora_ (must be where he called
26827 Monks the dayfather about Keyes's ad) _Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus,
26828 Stephen Dedalus B.,4., Edw. J. Lambert, Cornelius T. Kelleher, Joseph
26829 M'C Hynes, L. Boom, CP M'Coy,--M'lntosh and several others_.
26830 
26831 Nettled not a little by L. _Boom_ (as it incorrectly stated) and the
26832 line of bitched type but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M'Coy
26833 and Stephen Dedalus B. A. who were conspicuous, needless to say, by
26834 their total absence (to say nothing of M'Intosh) L. Boom pointed it
26835 out to his companion B. A. engaged in stifling another yawn, half
26836 nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of
26837 misprints.
26838 
26839 Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked as soon as his bottom
26840 jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.
26841 
26842 It is. Really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to
26843 the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could
26844 be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit
26845 flabbergasted at Myles Crawford's after all managing to. There.
26846 
26847 While the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the
26848 nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits
26849 and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three,
26850 his side. Value 1000 sovs with 3000 sovs in specie added. For entire
26851 colts and fillies. Mr F. Alexander's _Throwaway_, b. h. by _Rightaway_,
26852 5 yrs, 9 st 4 lbs (W. Lane) 1, lord Howard de Walden's _Zinfandel_ (M.
26853 Cannon) z, Mr W. Bass's _Sceptre_ 3. Betting 5 to 4 on _Zinfandel_,
26854 20 to 1 _Throwaway_ (off). _Sceptre_ a shade heavier, 5 to 4 on
26855 Zinfandel_, 20 to 1 _Throwaway_ (off). _Throwaway_ and _Zinfandel_
26856 stood close order. It was anybody's race then the rank outsider drew to
26857 the fore, got long lead, beating lord Howard de Walden's chestnut
26858 colt and Mr W. Bass's bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course. Winner
26859 trained by Braime so that Lenehan's version of the business was all pure
26860 buncombe. Secured the verdict cleverly by a length. 1000 sovs with
26861 3000 in specie. Also ran: J de Bremond's (French horse Bantam Lyons was
26862 anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute) _Maximum
26863 II_. Different ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though
26864 that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get
26865 left. Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing
26866 though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn't much reason to
26867 congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced
26868 itself to eventually.
26869 
26870 There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.
26871 
26872 Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.
26873 
26874 One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:
26875 Return of Parnell_. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was
26876 in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it
26877 was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for
26878 a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with
26879 no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone
26880 down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered
26881 his senses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they
26882 brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer
26883 general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.
26884 
26885 All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
26886 memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and
26887 not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it
26888 was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow
26889 of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly
26890 inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in
26891 his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when
26892 his various different political arrangements were nearing completion
26893 or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to
26894 change his boots and clothes-after a wetting when a cold resulted and
26895 failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he
26896 eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at
26897 an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken
26898 out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements
26899 even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which
26900 were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his
26901 starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the
26902 remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of
26903 possibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader
26904 of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter
26905 or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas
26906 Messrs So and So who, though they weren't even a patch on the former
26907 man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and
26908 far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay,
26909 and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual
26910 mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come
26911 back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the understudy in
26912 the title _rtle_ how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion
26913 when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United
26914 Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact,
26915 handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_,
26916 excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding
26917 the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what's
26918 bred in the bone. Still as regards return. You were a lucky dog if
26919 they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of
26920 shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And
26921 then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to
26922 produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case,
26923 Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat's name to the best of his
26924 recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show
26925 and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he
26926 might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship
26927 and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce
26928 himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace
26929 remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive,
26930 in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him,
26931 would have been to sound the lie of the land first.
26932 
26933 That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor
26934 commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.
26935 
26936 Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry
26937 Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man's thighs.
26938 I seen her picture in a barber's. The husband was a captain or an
26939 officer.
26940 
26941 Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.
26942 
26943 This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
26944 amount of laughter among his _entourage_. As regards Bloom he, without
26945 the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of
26946 the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused
26947 extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters
26948 worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed
26949 between them full of sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till
26950 nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by
26951 bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town
26952 till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few
26953 evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall
26954 though the thing was public property all along though not to anything
26955 like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since
26956 their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite,
26957 where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file
26958 from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom
26959 which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the
26960 packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses
26961 swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in
26962 the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance
26963 of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same
26964 fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply
26965 coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was
26966 it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with
26967 nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man
26968 arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim
26969 to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask
26970 in the loved one's smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial,
26971 needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to
26972 be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Poser.
26973 Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with
26974 affection, carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of
26975 manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as
26976 compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the
26977 usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in
26978 the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable
26979 doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own
26980 peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly
26981 likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the
26982 priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch
26983 adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman
26984 service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on
26985 their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations,
26986 very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of
26987 fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking
26988 back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of
26989 dream. And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it
26990 went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved
26991 with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he
26992 had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow
26993 since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or
26994 south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and
26995 simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the
26996 very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that
26997 wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting
26998 every shred of decency to the winds.
26999 
27000 Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to
27001 Stephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don't greatly mistake she
27002 was Spanish too.
27003 
27004 The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or
27005 other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and
27006 the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and
27007 so many.
27008 
27009 Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any
27010 means, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it
27011 was as she lived there. So, Spain.
27012 
27013 Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him
27014 by the by of that Cap l street library book out of date, he took out his
27015 pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly
27016 finally he.
27017 
27018 Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded
27019 photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?
27020 
27021 Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large
27022 sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she
27023 was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously
27024 low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than
27025 vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing
27026 near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old
27027 Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her
27028 the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about
27029 something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's
27030 premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic
27031 execution.
27032 
27033 Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom
27034 indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like
27035 her then.
27036 
27037 Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his
27038 1440 legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of
27039 Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency
27040 as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years
27041 numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking
27042 likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which
27043 came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the
27044 best advantage in that getup. She could without difficulty, he said,
27045 have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of
27046 the. He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female
27047 form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later
27048 than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, 1450 perfectly
27049 developed as works of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give
27050 the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes,
27051 puritanisme, it does though Saint Joseph's sovereign thievery alors
27052 Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas no photo could because it simply
27053 wasn't art in a word.
27054 
27055 The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good
27056 example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for
27057 itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for
27058 himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the
27059 camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional
27060 etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet
27061 wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.
27062 And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a
27063 kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.
27064 Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased
27065 by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away
27066 thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the
27067 other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving
27068 embonpoint_. In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like
27069 the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact
27070 with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp
27071 which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of
27072 his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and
27073 the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must
27074 have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot
27075 with apologies to Lindley Murray.
27076 
27077 The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
27078 distingui_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the
27079 bunch though you wouldn't think he had it in him yet you would. Besides
27080 he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though
27081 at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of
27082 makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur
27083 with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial
27084 tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest
27085 stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole
27086 business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up
27087 between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye
27088 was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and
27089 compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly
27090 cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and
27091 relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course
27092 intimate. Then the decree _nisi_ and the King's proctor tries to show
27093 cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made absolute. But as
27094 for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one
27095 another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till
27096 the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for
27097 the party wronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being
27098 close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on
27099 the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader's, who notoriously stuck to
27100 his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery,
27101 leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or
27102 possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the
27103 Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the
27104 by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or
27105 something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from
27106 the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging
27107 occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though
27108 palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though
27109 carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went
27110 a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast
27111 discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a
27112 pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were
27113 particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a
27114 minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that
27115 of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach,
27116 fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) a silk one was
27117 inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was
27118 the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence
27119 meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost
27120 celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away
27121 from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a
27122 stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more
27123 for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone
27124 instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of
27125 knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to
27126 the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you,
27127 sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the
27128 legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the
27129 course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after
27130 the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory
27131 after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.
27132 
27133 On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes
27134 of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing 1530
27135 immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
27136 wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
27137 for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
27138 husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from
27139 the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial
27140 moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms, drawing
27141 attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic
27142 rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and
27143 master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
27144 receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook
27145 the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though
27146 possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite
27147 possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical
27148 bias, believed and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either
27149 that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting
27150 list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world
27151 and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when,
27152 neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on
27153 for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on
27154 her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred
27155 on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive
27156 married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as
27157 several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.
27158 
27159 It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of
27160 brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time
27161 with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him
27162 his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take
27163 unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim
27164 ladies' society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest
27165 possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen
27166 about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who
27167 brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he
27168 would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea
27169 and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or
27170 triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and
27171 walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. To
27172 think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any
27173 stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things
27174 he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the
27175 other's senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly
27176 ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal
27177 nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.
27178 
27179 At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired
27180 though unwrinkled face.
27181 
27182 Some time yesterday, Stephen said.
27183 
27184 Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow
27185 Friday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!
27186 
27187 The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.
27188 
27189 Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.
27190 Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there
27191 somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the
27192 one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly
27193 some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to
27194 parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in
27195 retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had
27196 a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the
27197 evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in
27198 people's mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper
27199 or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't
27200 exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in
27201 thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern
27202 opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was
27203 subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a
27204 step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time
27205 inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly
27206 resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our
27207 friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he,
27208 though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
27209 mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give
27210 him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
27211 themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
27212 invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
27213 and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
27214 fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.
27215 
27216 Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it
27217 was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it
27218 was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue
27219 somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash
27220 altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed
27221 unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or
27222 the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he
27223 very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the
27224 other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount
27225 or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of
27226 the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him
27227 to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.
27228 His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over
27229 effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't what you
27230 call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was
27231 he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he
27232 did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal
27233 pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some
27234 wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding,
27235 eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps's cocoa and
27236 a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat
27237 doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as
27238 a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm
27239 in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.
27240 A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower
27241 in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any
27242 particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown
27243 and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties
27244 where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue
27245 to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come,
27246 alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with sixchamber
27247 revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze
27248 the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms
27249 betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large
27250 potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who
27251 he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra
27252 remarks _passim_. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle
27253 repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.
27254 People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled
27255 them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender
27256 Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they appeared to imagine he
27257 came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.
27258 
27259 I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while
27260 prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here you just come
27261 home with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the
27262 vicinity. You can't drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I'll just
27263 pay this lot.
27264 
27265 The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain
27266 sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper
27267 of the shanty who didn't seem to.
27268 
27269 Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of
27270 that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.
27271 
27272 All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B's) busy brain,
27273 education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
27274 up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed
27275 with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian
27276 with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other
27277 things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the
27278 housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted.
27279 Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his
27280 hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as
27281 well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of
27282 that particular red herring just to.
27283 
27284 The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former
27285 viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association
27286 dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this
27287 thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared
27288 to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell
27289 had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect.
27290 To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.
27291 
27292 Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner
27293 put in, manifesting some natural impatience.
27294 
27295 And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.
27296 
27297 The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles
27298 which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.
27299 
27300 Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk
27301 queried.
27302 
27303 Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was
27304 a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen
27305 portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.
27306 Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark,
27307 manner of speaking. _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite
27308 and _Red as a Rose is She._
27309 
27310 Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
27311 found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a
27312 hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which
27313 time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied
27314 loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched
27315 him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were
27316 sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
27317 that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial
27318 remark.
27319 
27320 To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first
27321 to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first
27322 and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for
27323 the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine
27324 host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were
27325 not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a
27326 grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in
27327 four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously
27328 spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him
27329 in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well
27330 worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.
27331 
27332 Come, he counselled to close the _siance_.
27333 
27334 Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the
27335 shelter or shanty together and the _ilite_ society of oilskin and
27336 company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their
27337 dolce far niente_. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and
27338 fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.
27339 
27340 One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of
27341 the moment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs
27342 upside down, on the tables in cafes. To which impromptu the neverfailing
27343 Bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off:
27344 
27345 To sweep the floor in the morning.
27346 
27347 So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same
27348 time apologetic to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the
27349 bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The
27350 night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit
27351 weak on his pins.
27352 
27353 It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in
27354 a moment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man.
27355 Come. It's not far. Lean on me.
27356 
27357 Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on
27358 accordingly.
27359 
27360 Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange
27361 kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and
27362 all that.
27363 
27364 Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where
27365 the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and
27366 purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming
27367 of fresh fields and pastures new. And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the
27368 analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the
27369 part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the
27370 time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
27371 selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.
27372 
27373 So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which
27374 Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made
27375 tracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though
27376 confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to
27377 follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's _Huguenots_,
27378 Meyerbeer's _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart's _Twelfth Mass_
27379 he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme
27380 of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into
27381 a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic
27382 church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as
27383 those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and i will live
27384 thy protestant to be_. He also yielded to none in his admiration of
27385 Rossini's _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,
27386 in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable
27387 sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laureis and
27388 putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers' church
27389 in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the
27390 doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather. There was the
27391 unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it
27392 to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was
27393 a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring
27394 preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,
27395 a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface
27396 knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And
27397 talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old
27398 favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel's air in _Martha,
27399 M'appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be
27400 more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the
27401 lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the
27402 number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in
27403 reply to a politely put query, said he didn't sing it but launched
27404 out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that
27405 period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the
27406 herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was
27407 contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite
27408 recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas
27409 and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd
27410 William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's chapel or
27411 anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and
27412 John Bull.
27413 
27414 On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
27415 the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
27416 brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not
27417 perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive
27418 guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political
27419 celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a
27420 striking coincidence.
27421 
27422 By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,
27423 who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other's sleeve
27424 gently, jocosely remarking:
27425 
27426 Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.
27427 
27428 They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
27429 anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite
27430 near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh
27431 because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a
27432 taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the
27433 lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such
27434 a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he
27435 wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency
27436 that might crop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a
27437 horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected,
27438 take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy
27439 horror to face. But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was
27440 built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes
27441 into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or
27442 trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a
27443 harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the
27444 joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely
27445 reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat
27446 distracted from Stephen's words while the ship of the street was
27447 manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.
27448 
27449 What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging
27450 in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your
27451 acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.
27452 
27453 He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,
27454 image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome
27455 blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as
27456 he was perhaps not that way built.
27457 
27458 Still, supposing he had his father's gift as he more than suspected,
27459 it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall's Irish
27460 industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.
27461 
27462 Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has
27463 End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows
27464 come from. Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_
27465 about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,
27466 which boggled Bloom a bit:
27467 
27468      _Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
27469      Tun die Poeten dichten._
27470 
27471 These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_. Bloom, nodding,
27472 said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which
27473 he did.
27474 
27475 A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,
27476 which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,
27477 if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production
27478 such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain,
27479 command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for
27480 its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrie_ into fashionable
27481 houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large
27482 way of business and titled people where with his university degree of
27483 B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more
27484 influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct
27485 success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the
27486 purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended
27487 to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a
27488 youthful tyro in--society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a
27489 little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a
27490 matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their
27491 musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the
27492 Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes
27493 of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation,
27494 cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record--in fact, without
27495 giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could
27496 easily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument
27497 by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition
27498 fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need
27499 necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy
27500 space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or
27501 nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his
27502 dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to
27503 be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.
27504 Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original
27505 music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly
27506 have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical
27507 world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a
27508 confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus
27509 omne_. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in
27510 his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win
27511 a high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure
27512 and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King
27513 street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him
27514 upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the
27515 goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often
27516 tripped-up a too much fjted prince of good fellows. And it need not
27517 detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would
27518 have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when
27519 desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or
27520 containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself
27521 alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason
27522 why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat
27523 of any sort, hung on to him at all.
27524 
27525 The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he
27526 purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on
27527 the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his
27528 connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was
27529 prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious
27530 pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it
27531 which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of
27532 a person's character, no pun intended.
27533 
27534 The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,
27535 rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on
27536 the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking
27537 globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full
27538 crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had
27539 ended, patient in his scythed car.
27540 
27541 Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed
27542 through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping
27543 over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,
27544 Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.
27545 
27546 Und alle Schiffe br|cken._
27547 
27548 The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely
27549 watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,
27550 one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by
27551 Father Maher_. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again
27552 continuing their _tjte-`-tjte_ (which, of course, he was utterly out
27553 of) about sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other
27554 topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind
27555 while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the
27556 sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too
27557 far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and
27558 looked after their lowbacked car_.
27559 
27560 
27561 
27562 What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?
27563 
27564 Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they
27565 followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and
27566 Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,
27567 Gardiner's place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
27568 Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing
27569 right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching,
27570 disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before
27571 George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than
27572 the arc which it subtends.
27573 
27574 
27575 Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?
27576 
27577 Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
27578 prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
27579 glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed
27580 corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,
27581 ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,
27582 the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the
27583 presabbath, Stephen's collapse.
27584 
27585 Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective
27586 like and unlike reactions to experience?
27587 
27588 Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
27589 plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
27590 of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both
27591 indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
27592 heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
27593 religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted
27594 the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
27595 magnetism.
27596 
27597 
27598 Were their views on some points divergent?
27599 
27600 Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of dietary
27601 and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views
27602 on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom
27603 assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism
27604 involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
27605 christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
27606 son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of
27607 Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (died
27608 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty
27609 and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to
27610 gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
27611 adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
27612 the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
27613 attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
27614 from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first
27615 no bigger than a woman's hand.
27616 
27617 
27618 Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?
27619 
27620 The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
27621 paraheliotropic trees.
27622 
27623 
27624 Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
27625 the past?
27626 
27627 In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
27628 thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's
27629 corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.
27630 
27631 In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall
27632 between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony
27633 of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and
27634 prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
27635 railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian
27636 Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on
27637 the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once
27638 in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour
27639 of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.
27640 
27641 
27642 What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
27643 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at
27644 their destination?
27645 
27646 He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
27647 development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction
27648 of the converse domain of interindividual relations.
27649 
27650 
27651 As in what ways?
27652 
27653 From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
27654 existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence
27655 to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.
27656 
27657 What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?
27658 
27659 At the housesteps of the 4th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number
27660 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket
27661 of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.
27662 
27663 
27664 Was it there?
27665 
27666 It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
27667 the day but one preceding.
27668 
27669 
27670 Why was he doubly irritated?
27671 
27672 Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
27673 himself twice not to forget.
27674 
27675 
27676 What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
27677 respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?
27678 
27679 To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.
27680 
27681 
27682 Bloom's decision?
27683 
27684 A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
27685 area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
27686 the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
27687 length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches
27688 of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by
27689 separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for
27690 the impact of the fall.
27691 
27692 
27693 Did he fall?
27694 
27695 By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
27696 avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for
27697 periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,
27698 pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast
27699 of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year
27700 one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five
27701 thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three
27702 hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,
27703 dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.
27704 
27705 
27706 Did he rise uninjured by concussion?
27707 
27708 Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
27709 the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force
27710 at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied
27711 at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the
27712 subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free
27713 inflammable coal gas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which,
27714 by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a
27715 portable candle.
27716 
27717 
27718 What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?
27719 
27720 Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
27721 kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a
27722 candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
27723 leaving the kitchen holding a candle.
27724 
27725 
27726 Did the man reappear elsewhere?
27727 
27728 After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
27729 through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
27730 halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space
27731 of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.
27732 
27733 
27734 Did Stephen obey his sign?
27735 
27736 Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
27737 softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted
27738 candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down
27739 a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's
27740 house.
27741 
27742 
27743 What did Bloom do?
27744 
27745 He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its
27746 flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for
27747 Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when
27748 necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid
27749 resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons
27750 of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs
27751 Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting
27752 points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing
27753 the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and
27754 hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.
27755 
27756 
27757 Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?
27758 
27759 Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
27760 had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the
27761 college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the
27762 county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room
27763 of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street:
27764 of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss
27765 Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie
27766 Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil
27767 street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of
27768 number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of
27769 Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the
27770 physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's Green, north: of
27771 his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.
27772 
27773 
27774 What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from
27775 the fire towards the opposite wall?
27776 
27777 Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,
27778 stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the
27779 chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs
27780 folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of
27781 ladies' grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual
27782 position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
27783 extremities and the third at their point of junction.
27784 
27785 
27786 What did Bloom see on the range?
27787 
27788 On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left
27789 larger) hob a black iron kettle.
27790 
27791 
27792 What did Bloom do at the range?
27793 
27794 He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron
27795 kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to
27796 let it flow.
27797 
27798 
27799 Did it flow?
27800 
27801 Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of
27802 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of
27803 filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial
27804 plant cost of 5 pounds per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown,
27805 Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan,
27806 a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of
27807 relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at
27808 Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth
27809 and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below
27810 the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and
27811 waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of
27812 the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for
27813 purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of
27814 recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals
27815 as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding
27816 their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch
27817 meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by
27818 a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of
27819 the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the
27820 detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,
27821 solvent, sound.
27822 
27823 What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
27824 returning to the range, admire?
27825 
27826 Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
27827 in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's
27828 projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific
27829 exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface
27830 particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence
27831 of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic
27832 quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides:
27833 its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar
27834 icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance:
27835 its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its
27836 indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region
27837 below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability
27838 of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve
27839 and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of
27840 tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and
27841 islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas
27842 and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and
27843 volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns:
27844 its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones:
27845 its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and
27846 confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic
27847 currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence
27848 in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
27849 freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
27850 cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
27851 its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and
27852 latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments
27853 and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown
27854 gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its
27855 composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part
27856 of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead
27857 Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate
27858 dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst
27859 and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and
27860 paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow,
27861 hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs
27862 and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and
27863 archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and
27864 arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility
27865 in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power
27866 stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,
27867 rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality
27868 derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level
27869 to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe),
27870 numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its
27871 ubiquity as constituting 90 percent of the human body: the noxiousness
27872 of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded
27873 flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
27874 
27875 
27876 Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
27877 return to the stillflowing tap?
27878 
27879 To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
27880 Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought
27881 thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh
27882 cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a
27883 long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.
27884 
27885 
27886 What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?
27887 
27888 That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
27889 submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month
27890 of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of
27891 glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.
27892 
27893 
27894 What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
27895 prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a
27896 preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with
27897 rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region
27898 in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most
27899 sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?
27900 
27901 The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.
27902 
27903 
27904 What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?
27905 
27906 Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric
27907 energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the
27908 lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.
27909 
27910 
27911 Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?
27912 
27913 Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
27914 recuperation.
27915 
27916 
27917 What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
27918 agency of fire?
27919 
27920 The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of
27921 ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was
27922 communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral
27923 masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the
27924 foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn
27925 derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat
27926 radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous
27927 ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such
27928 combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source
27929 of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
27930 through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part
27931 reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising
27932 the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in
27933 temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal
27934 units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees
27935 Fahrenheit.
27936 
27937 
27938 What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?
27939 
27940 A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
27941 both sides simultaneously.
27942 
27943 
27944 For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?
27945 
27946 To shave himself.
27947 
27948 
27949 What advantages attended shaving by night?
27950 
27951 A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
27952 shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly
27953 encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:
27954 quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when
27955 awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and
27956 perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper
27957 read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a
27958 shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might
27959 cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with
27960 precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.
27961 
27962 
27963 Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?
27964 
27965 Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
27966 feminine passive active hand.
27967 
27968 
27969 What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
27970 influence?
27971 
27972 The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
27973 blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their
27974 natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic
27975 surgery.
27976 
27977 
27978 What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the
27979 kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?
27980 
27981 On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal
27982 breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a
27983 moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
27984 goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly
27985 copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. On the middle shelf
27986 a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four
27987 conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
27988 Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and
27989 containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and
27990 Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue
27991 paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's
27992 choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical
27993 canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one,
27994 the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with
27995 augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream,
27996 a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured
27997 adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and
27998 semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr
27999 Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total
28000 quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish
28001 containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of
28002 jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.
28003 
28004 
28005 What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?
28006 
28007 Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,
28008 numbered 8 87, 88 6.
28009 
28010 
28011 What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?
28012 
28013 Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,
28014 preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official
28015 and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_,
28016 late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.
28017 
28018 
28019 Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,
28020 been received by him?
28021 
28022 In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain
28023 street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell
28024 street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in
28025 his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah,
28026 restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of
28027 F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick
28028 M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and
28029 restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman's Journal and
28030 National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently
28031 thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of
28032 the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of
28033 inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the
28034 secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.
28035 
28036 What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?
28037 
28038 The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
28039 followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
28040 electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss
28041 by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding
28042 originally from a successful interpretation.
28043 
28044 
28045 His mood?
28046 
28047 He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
28048 was satisfied.
28049 
28050 
28051 What satisfied him?
28052 
28053 To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to
28054 others. Light to the gentiles.
28055 
28056 
28057 How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?
28058 
28059 He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's
28060 soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed
28061 on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the
28062 prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity
28063 prescribed.
28064 
28065 
28066 What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
28067 guest?
28068 
28069 Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
28070 Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),
28071 he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served
28072 extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the
28073 viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion
28074 Molly).
28075 
28076 
28077 Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
28078 hospitality?
28079 
28080 His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted
28081 them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct,
28082 the creature cocoa.
28083 
28084 
28085 Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
28086 reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
28087 complete the act begun?
28088 
28089 The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right
28090 side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four
28091 lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable
28092 condition.
28093 
28094 
28095 Who drank more quickly?
28096 
28097 Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,
28098 from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady
28099 flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to
28100 two, nine to three.
28101 
28102 
28103 What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?
28104 
28105 Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
28106 engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from
28107 literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had
28108 applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the
28109 solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.
28110 
28111 
28112 Had he found their solution?
28113 
28114 In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
28115 aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,
28116 the answers not bearing in all points.
28117 
28118 
28119 What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
28120 potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering
28121 of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the
28122 Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?
28123 
28124      _An ambition to squint
28125      At my verses in print
28126      Makes me hope that for these you'll find room?.
28127      If you so condescend
28128      Then please place at the end
28129      The name of yours truly, L. Bloom._
28130 
28131 Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?
28132 
28133 Name, age, race, creed.
28134 
28135 
28136 What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?
28137 
28138      Leopold Bloom
28139      Ellpodbomool
28140      Molldopeloob
28141      Bollopedoom
28142      Old Ollebo, M. P.
28143 
28144 
28145 What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic
28146 poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?
28147 
28148      _Poets oft have sung in rhyme
28149      Of music sweet their praise divine.
28150      Let them hymn it nine times nine.
28151      Dearer far than song or wine.
28152      You are mine. The world is mine._
28153 
28154 
28155 What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.
28156 Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,
28157 entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_,
28158 commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,
28159 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the
28160 valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand
28161 annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R Shelton
28162 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George
28163 A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under
28164 the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir,
28165 harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal
28166 girl?
28167 
28168 Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,
28169 the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded
28170 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
28171 secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
28172 questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the
28173 duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru
28174 imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
28175 professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand
28176 Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:
28177 fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's
28178 non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
28179 and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white
28180 articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
28181 while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the
28182 difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
28183 allusions from _Everybody's Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in
28184 every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated
28185 with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high
28186 sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket
28187 Barton.
28188 
28189 
28190 What relation existed between their ages?
28191 
28192 16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen
28193 was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present
28194 age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54
28195 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
28196 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
28197 as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
28198 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
28199 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen
28200 would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
28201 Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,
28202 being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
28203 surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah,
28204 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would
28205 attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to
28206 have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in
28207 the year 81,396 B.C.
28208 
28209 
28210 What events might nullify these calculations?
28211 
28212 The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a
28213 new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
28214 extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.
28215 
28216 
28217 How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?
28218 
28219 Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina
28220 Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's
28221 mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his
28222 hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a
28223 rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father
28224 and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.
28225 
28226 
28227 Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
28228 afterwards seconded by the father?
28229 
28230 Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
28231 gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.
28232 
28233 
28234 Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
28235 third connecting link between them?
28236 
28237 Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
28238 house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and
28239 had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms
28240 Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts
28241 of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom
28242 who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the
28243 employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of
28244 sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.
28245 
28246 
28247 Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?
28248 
28249 He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
28250 of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair
28251 with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North
28252 Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had
28253 remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular
28254 fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles
28255 equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,
28256 private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from
28257 the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.
28258 
28259 
28260 Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?
28261 
28262 Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel
28263 of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with
28264 continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,
28265 velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round
28266 and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.
28267 
28268 
28269 What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years
28270 deceased?
28271 
28272 The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
28273 suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient
28274 catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue
28275 of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles
28276 Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.
28277 
28278 
28279 Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
28280 which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the
28281 more desirable?
28282 
28283 The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
28284 abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's _Physical Strength and How to
28285 Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
28286 sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in
28287 front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of
28288 muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant
28289 relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.
28290 
28291 
28292 Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?
28293 
28294 Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
28295 circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he
28296 had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever
28297 movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed
28298 abdominal muscles.
28299 
28300 
28301 Did either openly allude to their racial difference?
28302 
28303 Neither.
28304 
28305 
28306 What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts
28307 about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen's thoughts about
28308 Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?
28309 
28310 He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he
28311 knew that he knew that he was not.
28312 
28313 
28314 What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
28315 parentages?
28316 
28317 Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently
28318 Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and
28319 Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born
28320 Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male
28321 consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary,
28322 daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).
28323 
28324 
28325 Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
28326 layman?
28327 
28328 Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone,
28329 in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James
28330 O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
28331 in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in
28332 the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend
28333 Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons,
28334 Rathgar.
28335 
28336 
28337 Did they find their educational careers similar?
28338 
28339 Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
28340 through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for
28341 Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,
28342 junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the
28343 matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the
28344 royal university.
28345 
28346 
28347 Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university
28348 of life?
28349 
28350 Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation
28351 had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.
28352 
28353 
28354 What two temperaments did they individually represent?
28355 
28356 The scientific. The artistic.
28357 
28358 
28359 What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
28360 applied, rather than towards pure, science?
28361 
28362 Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining
28363 in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his
28364 appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
28365 revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting
28366 telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water
28367 siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.
28368 
28369 
28370 Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
28371 kindergarten?
28372 
28373 Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
28374 catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the
28375 twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature
28376 mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical
28377 to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,
28378 historically costumed dolls.
28379 
28380 
28381 What also stimulated him in his cogitations?
28382 
28383 The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,
28384 the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George's street, south, the latter
28385 at his 6 1/2d shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30
28386 Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities
28387 hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed
28388 in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility
28389 divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of
28390 magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to
28391 convince, to decide.
28392 
28393 
28394 Such as?
28395 
28396 K. II. Kino's 11/- Trousers. House of Keys. Alexander J. Keyes.
28397 
28398 
28399 Such as not?

28402 gratis 1 pair of our special non-compo boots, guaranteed 1 candle power.
28403 Address: Barclay and Cook, 18 Talbot street.
28404 
28405 Bacilikil (Insect Powder). Veribest (Boot Blacking). Uwantit (Combined
28406 pocket twoblade penknife with corkscrew, nailfile and pipecleaner).
28407 
28408 
28409 Such as never?
28410 
28411 What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?
28412 
28413 Incomplete.
28414 
28415 With it an abode of bliss.
28416 
28417 Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in
28418 4 oz pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda
28419 Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries
28420 of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree in a meatpot,
28421 registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat.
28422 Plamtroo.
28423 
28424 
28425 Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that
28426 originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably
28427 conduce to success?
28428 
28429 His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn
28430 by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be
28431 seated engaged in writing.
28432 
28433 
28434 What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?
28435 
28436 Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark
28437 corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She
28438 sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks.
28439 On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs.
28440 Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He
28441 seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads.
28442 Solitary.
28443 
28444 
28445 What?
28446 
28447 In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's Hotel, Queen's Hotel, Queen's
28448 Hotel. Queen's Ho...
28449 
28450 
28451 What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?
28452 
28453 The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
28454 Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,
28455 in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in
28456 the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment
28457 to I of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the
28458 morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17
28459 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having,
28460 purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater
28461 straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of
28462 having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin
28463 aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street,
28464 Ennis.
28465 
28466 
28467 Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or
28468 intuition?
28469 
28470 Coincidence.
28471 
28472 
28473 Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?
28474 
28475 He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's
28476 words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament
28477 relieved.
28478 
28479 
28480 Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to
28481 him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The
28482 Parable of the Plums_?
28483 
28484 It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
28485 implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
28486 e.g. _My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)
28487 composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and
28488 in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of
28489 financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially
28490 collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent
28491 merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or
28492 contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy
28493 or Doctor Dick or Heblon's _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of
28494 certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual
28495 stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful
28496 narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during
28497 the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice
28498 on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius
28499 Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.
28500 
28501 
28502 Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other
28503 frequently engaged his mind?
28504 
28505 What to do with our wives.
28506 
28507 
28508 What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?
28509 
28510 Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
28511 nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,
28512 chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the
28513 policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano
28514 and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing:
28515 biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as
28516 pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in
28517 a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of
28518 erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically
28519 controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals
28520 and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female
28521 acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of
28522 evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction
28523 agreeable.
28524 
28525 
28526 What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
28527 in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?
28528 
28529 In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
28530 with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and
28531 Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
28532 as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of
28533 a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political
28534 complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating
28535 the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.
28536 After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned
28537 the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to
28538 the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual
28539 polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false
28540 analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a
28541 mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).
28542 
28543 
28544 What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
28545 such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?
28546 
28547 The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all
28548 balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her
28549 proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.
28550 
28551 
28552 How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?
28553 
28554 Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
28555 certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent
28556 knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's
28557 ignorant lapse.
28558 
28559 
28560 With what success had he attempted direct instruction?
28561 
28562 She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
28563 comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
28564 remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated
28565 with error.
28566 
28567 
28568 What system had proved more effective?
28569 
28570 Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.
28571 
28572 
28573 Example?
28574 
28575 She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
28576 disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
28577 hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.
28578 
28579 
28580 Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of
28581 postexilic eminence did he adduce?
28582 
28583 Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,
28584 author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn
28585 of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there
28586 arose none like Moses (Maimonides).
28587 
28588 
28589 What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth
28590 seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by
28591 Stephen?
28592 
28593 That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
28594 name uncertain.
28595 
28596 
28597 Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
28598 selected or rejected race mentioned?
28599 
28600 Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
28601 Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).
28602 
28603 
28604 What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish
28605 languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts
28606 by guest to host and by host to guest?
28607 
28608 By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_
28609 walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).
28610 
28611 
28612 By Bloom: _Kkifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch_ (thy temple
28613 amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).
28614 
28615 
28616 How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages
28617 made in substantiation of the oral comparison?
28618 
28619 By juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior
28620 literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so
28621 manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of
28622 the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish
28623 characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
28624 wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of
28625 mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal
28626 and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.
28627 
28628 
28629 Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
28630 extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?
28631 
28632 Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence
28633 and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.
28634 
28635 
28636 What points of contact existed between these languages and between the
28637 peoples who spoke them?
28638 
28639 The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
28640 servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been
28641 taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary
28642 instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel,
28643 and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their
28644 archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic,
28645 toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works
28646 of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor,
28647 Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth,
28648 Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the
28649 isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.
28650 Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription
28651 of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the
28652 restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish
28653 political autonomy or devolution.
28654 
28655 
28656 What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,
28657 ethnically irreducible consummation?
28658 
28659      _Kolod balejwaw pnimah
28660      Nefesch, jehudi, homijah._
28661 
28662 
28663 Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?
28664 
28665 In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.
28666 
28667 
28668 How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?
28669 
28670 By a periphrastic version of the general text.
28671 
28672 
28673 In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?
28674 
28675 The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
28676 hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
28677 modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
28678 Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic). Did
28679 the guest comply with his host's request?
28680 
28681 Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.
28682 
28683 What was Stephen's auditive sensation?
28684 
28685 He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
28686 of the past.
28687 
28688 
28689 What was Bloom's visual sensation?
28690 
28691 He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a
28692 future.
28693 
28694 
28695 What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional
28696 quasisensations of concealed identities?
28697 
28698 Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted
28699 by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as
28700 leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair. Auditively, Bloom's: The
28701 traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.
28702 
28703 
28704 What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with
28705 what exemplars?
28706 
28707 In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very
28708 reverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of
28709 Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish:
28710 exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage modern
28711 or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian Osmond
28712 Tearle (died 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.
28713 
28714 
28715 Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange
28716 legend on an allied theme?
28717 
28718 Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being
28719 secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid
28720 residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream
28721 plus cocoa, having been consumed.
28722 
28723 
28724 Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.
28725 
28726      _Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all
28727      Went out for to play ball.
28728      And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
28729      He drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.
28730      And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
28731      He broke the jew's windows all._
28732 
28733 
28734 
28735 How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?
28736 
28737 
28738 With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew he heard with pleasure and saw the
28739 unbroken kitchen window.
28740 
28741 
28742 Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.
28743 
28744      _Then out there came the jew's daughter
28745      And she all dressed in green.
28746      "Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
28747      And play your ball again."
28748 
28749      "I can't come back and I won't come back
28750      Without my schoolfellows all.
28751      For if my master he did hear
28752      He'd make it a sorry ball."
28753 
28754      She took him by the lilywhite hand
28755      And led him along the hall
28756      Until she led him to a room
28757      Where none could hear him call.
28758 
28759      She took a penknife out of her pocket
28760      And cut off his little head.
28761      And now he'll play his ball no more
28762      For he lies among the dead._
28763 
28764 
28765 How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?
28766 
28767 With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's
28768 daughter, all dressed in green.
28769 
28770 
28771 Condense Stephen's commentary.
28772 
28773 One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
28774 inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he
28775 is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope
28776 and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation,
28777 to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him,
28778 consenting.
28779 
28780 
28781 Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?
28782 
28783 He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
28784 should by him not be told.
28785 
28786 
28787 Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?
28788 
28789 In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.
28790 
28791 
28792 Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?
28793 
28794 He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
28795 incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
28796 propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
28797 opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
28798 atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
28799 hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
28800 
28801 
28802 From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
28803 totally immune?
28804 
28805 From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
28806 sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
28807 indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From
28808 somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and
28809 crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained
28810 its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
28811 sleeping.
28812 
28813 
28814 Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
28815 of his family?
28816 
28817 Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
28818 Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation
28819 of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night
28820 attire with a vacant mute expression.
28821 
28822 
28823 What other infantile memories had he of her?
28824 
28825 15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
28826 lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks
28827 her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,
28828 tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,
28829 she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,
28830 Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British
28831 navy.
28832 
28833 
28834 What endemic characteristics were present?
28835 
28836 Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct
28837 line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant
28838 intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.
28839 
28840 
28841 What memories had he of her adolescence?
28842 
28843 She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn,
28844 entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and
28845 take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South
28846 Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual
28847 of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned
28848 abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th
28849 anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county
28850 Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year
28851 not stated).
28852 
28853 
28854 Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
28855 
28856 Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.
28857 
28858 
28859 What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,
28860 if differently?
28861 
28862 A temporary departure of his cat.
28863 
28864 
28865 Why similarly, why differently?
28866 
28867 Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
28868 
28869 Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,
28870 because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the
28871 habitation.
28872 
28873 
28874 In other respects were their differences similar?
28875 
28876 In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
28877 unexpectedness.
28878 
28879 
28880 As?
28881 
28882 Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it
28883 for her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake
28884 in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented
28885 spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the
28886 constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
28887 mousewatching cat).
28888 
28889 Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences
28890 of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf
28891 earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had
28892 an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been
28893 Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which
28894 it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in
28895 passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness,
28896 their differences were similar.
28897 
28898 
28899 In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, (2) a clock, given as
28900 matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?
28901 
28902 As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
28903 animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
28904 vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
28905 pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation
28906 in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of
28907 clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the
28908 recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the
28909 shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, 5
28910 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.
28911 
28912 
28913 In what manners did she reciprocate?
28914 
28915 She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to
28916 him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.
28917 She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases
28918 had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his
28919 necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon
28920 having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire
28921 to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the
28922 moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.
28923 
28924 
28925 What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make
28926 to Stephen, noctambulist?
28927 
28928 To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
28929 Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
28930 above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
28931 his host and hostess.
28932 
28933 
28934 What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation
28935 of such an extemporisation?
28936 
28937 For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the
28938 host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the
28939 hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
28940 pronunciation.
28941 
28942 
28943 Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and
28944 a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
28945 eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's
28946 daughter?
28947 
28948 Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother
28949 through daughter.
28950 
28951 
28952 To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
28953 return a monosyllabic negative answer?
28954 
28955 If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney
28956 Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.
28957 
28958 
28959 What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the
28960 host?
28961 
28962 A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
28963 of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the
28964 anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).
28965 
28966 
28967 Was the proposal of asylum accepted?
28968 
28969 Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.
28970 What exchange of money took place between host and guest?
28971 
28972 The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money
28973 1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to
28974 the former.
28975 
28976 
28977 What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
28978 declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?
28979 
28980 To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place
28981 the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal
28982 instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate
28983 a series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,
28984 places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in
28985 the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and
28986 E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare
28987 street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a
28988 public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two
28989 or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line
28990 drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in
28991 different places).
28992 
28993 
28994 What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
28995 selfexcluding propositions?
28996 
28997 The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
28998 Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive
28999 particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring
29000 to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had
29001 publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his
29002 the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the
29003 summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches
29004 on the milled edge and tendered it m payment of an account due to and
29005 received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand
29006 Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,
29007 circuitous or direct, return.
29008 
29009 
29010 Was the clown Bloom's son?
29011 
29012 No.
29013 
29014 
29015 Had Bloom's coin returned?
29016 
29017 Never.
29018 
29019 
29020 Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?
29021 
29022 Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
29023 amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
29024 international animosity. He believed then that human life was infinitely
29025 perfectible, eliminating these conditions?
29026 
29027 There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
29028 from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
29029 destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
29030 the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
29031 death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
29032 females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
29033 accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
29034 and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
29035 criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
29036 terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres
29037 of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital
29038 growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
29039 maturity to decay.
29040 
29041 
29042 Why did he desist from speculation?
29043 
29044 Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
29045 more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena
29046 to be removed.
29047 
29048 
29049 Did Stephen participate in his dejection?
29050 
29051 He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
29052 syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
29053 reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the
29054 incertitude of the void.
29055 
29056 
29057 Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?
29058 
29059 Not verbally. Substantially.
29060 
29061 
29062 What comforted his misapprehension?
29063 
29064 That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
29065 the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.
29066 
29067 
29068 In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus
29069 from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?
29070 
29071 Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
29072 
29073 BLOOM
29074 
29075 Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
29076 
29077 STEPHEN:
29078 
29079 
29080 With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?
29081 
29082 The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israel de Egypto: domus Jacob de
29083 populo barbaro_.
29084 
29085 
29086 What did each do at the door of egress?
29087 
29088 Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.
29089 
29090 
29091 For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?
29092 
29093 For a cat.
29094 
29095 
29096 What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the
29097 guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from
29098 the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?
29099 
29100 The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.
29101 
29102 
29103 With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
29104 companion of various constellations?
29105 
29106 Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
29107 incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
29108 scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
29109 observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
29110 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius
29111 alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant
29112 and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the
29113 precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and
29114 nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund
29115 and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging
29116 towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic
29117 drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from
29118 immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with
29119 which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a
29120 parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.
29121 
29122 
29123 Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?
29124 
29125 Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the
29126 earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed
29127 in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds,
29128 of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable
29129 trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained
29130 by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe
29131 of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves
29132 universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in
29133 continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was
29134 again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends
29135 and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the
29136 progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.
29137 
29138 
29139 Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?
29140 
29141 Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem
29142 of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a
29143 number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude
29144 and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that,
29145 the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000
29146 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to
29147 be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed
29148 integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands,
29149 hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions,
29150 billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series
29151 containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost
29152 kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.
29153 
29154 
29155 Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their
29156 satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and
29157 moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?
29158 
29159 Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,
29160 normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons,
29161 when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
29162 suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as
29163 the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was
29164 approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,
29165 when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a
29166 working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more
29167 adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
29168 subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,
29169 Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though
29170 an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite
29171 differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would
29172 probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to
29173 vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.
29174 
29175      And the problem of possible redemption?
29176      The minor was proved by the major.
29177 
29178 
29179 Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?
29180 
29181 The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,
29182 yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:
29183 their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:
29184 the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular
29185 cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the
29186 interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous
29187 discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,
29188 Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes
29189 of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
29190 compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive
29191 and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of
29192 meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth
29193 of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers
29194 about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, lo August): the
29195 monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms:
29196 the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a
29197 star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and
29198 day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in
29199 incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the
29200 birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting
29201 constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar
29202 origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared
29203 from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period
29204 of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar
29205 origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared
29206 from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of
29207 Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years
29208 after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from
29209 other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of
29210 other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar,
29211 from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow,
29212 taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular
29213 animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters,
29214 pallor of human beings.
29215 
29216 
29217 His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing
29218 for possible error?
29219 
29220 That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not
29221 a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from
29222 the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
29223 suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of
29224 different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,
29225 remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a
29226 present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
29227 existence.
29228 
29229 
29230 Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?
29231 
29232 Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
29233 delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
29234 invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
29235 satellite of their planet.
29236 
29237 
29238 Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
29239 influences upon sublunary disasters?
29240 
29241 It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the
29242 nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to
29243 verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the
29244 sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.
29245 
29246 
29247 What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
29248 woman?
29249 
29250 Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
29251 generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence:
29252 her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising
29253 and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
29254 invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative
29255 interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power
29256 to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to
29257 incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her
29258 visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent
29259 propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her
29260 light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her
29261 arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction,
29262 when invisible.
29263 
29264 
29265 What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's,
29266 gaze?
29267 
29268 In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a
29269 paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
29270 blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving
29271 shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.
29272 
29273 
29274 How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his
29275 wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?
29276 
29277 With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
29278 affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with
29279 suggestion.
29280 
29281 
29282 Both then were silent?
29283 
29284 Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
29285 flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.
29286 
29287 
29288 Were they indefinitely inactive?
29289 
29290 At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen,
29291 then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs
29292 of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition,
29293 their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected
29294 luminous and semiluminous shadow.
29295 
29296 
29297 Similarly?
29298 
29299 The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
29300 were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of
29301 the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate
29302 year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point
29303 of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the
29304 institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the
29305 ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption
29306 an insistent vesical pressure.
29307 
29308 
29309 What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
29310 invisible audible collateral organ of the other?
29311 
29312 To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,
29313 reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.
29314 
29315 To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised
29316 I January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from
29317 unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine
29318 prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
29319 church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of
29320 the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine
29321 excrescences as hair and toenails.
29322 
29323 
29324 What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?
29325 
29326 A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament
29327 from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress
29328 of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.
29329 
29330 
29331 How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal
29332 departer?
29333 
29334 By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
29335 unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and
29336 turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its
29337 staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and
29338 revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.
29339 
29340 
29341 How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?
29342 
29343 Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its
29344 base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and
29345 forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.
29346 
29347 
29348 What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their
29349 respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?
29350 
29351 The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells
29352 in the church of Saint George.
29353 
29354 
29355 What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?
29356 
29357 By Stephen:
29358 
29359 Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet. Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus
29360 excipiat._
29361 
29362 By Bloom:
29363 
29364      _Heigho, heigho,
29365      Heigho, heigho._
29366 
29367 
29368 Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day
29369 at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south
29370 to Glasnevin in the north?
29371 
29372 Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed),
29373 Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John
29374 Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed),
29375 Paddy Dignam (in the grave).
29376 
29377 
29378 Alone, what did Bloom hear?
29379 
29380 The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the
29381 double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.
29382 
29383 
29384 Alone, what did Bloom feel?
29385 
29386 The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing
29387 point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Reaumur: the
29388 incipient intimations of proximate dawn.
29389 
29390 
29391 Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
29392 him?
29393 
29394 Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy
29395 Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,
29396 Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin
29397 Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis,
29398 Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).
29399 
29400 
29401 What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?
29402 
29403 The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the
29404 apparition of a new solar disk.
29405 
29406 
29407 Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?
29408 
29409 Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house
29410 of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition
29411 of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the
29412 direction of Mizrach, the east.
29413 
29414 
29415 He remembered the initial paraphenomena?
29416 
29417 More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
29418 various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,
29419 the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the
29420 first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.
29421 
29422 
29423 Did he remain?
29424 
29425 With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
29426 the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the
29427 candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room,
29428 hallfloor, and reentered.
29429 
29430 
29431 What suddenly arrested his ingress?
29432 
29433 The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
29434 contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible
29435 fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in
29436 consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.
29437 
29438 
29439 Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of
29440 furniture.
29441 
29442 A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
29443 the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an
29444 alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and
29445 white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
29446 door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
29447 a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had
29448 been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
29449 more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
29450 from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied
29451 by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.
29452 
29453 
29454 Describe them.
29455 
29456 One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back
29457 slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an
29458 irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply
29459 upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.
29460 The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed
29461 directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat
29462 to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of
29463 white plaited rush.
29464 
29465 
29466 What significances attached to these two chairs?
29467 
29468 Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial
29469 evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
29470 
29471 
29472 What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?
29473 
29474 A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin
29475 supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray
29476 containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two
29477 discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in
29478 the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love's Old Sweet Song_
29479 words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam
29480 Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications
29481 ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,
29482 close.
29483 
29484 
29485 With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?
29486 
29487 With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right
29488 temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on
29489 a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
29490 bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
29491 remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the
29492 gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent
29493 act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility
29494 the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
29495 discolouration.
29496 
29497 
29498 His next proceeding?
29499 
29500 From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
29501 diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on
29502 a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
29503 mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
29504 illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined
29505 it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
29506 candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
29507 latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
29508 of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to
29509 facilitate total combustion.
29510 
29511 
29512 What followed this operation?
29513 
29514 The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
29515 vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.
29516 
29517 
29518 What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
29519 mantelpiece?
29520 
29521 A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
29522 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf
29523 tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
29524 gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
29525 Alderman John Hooper.
29526 
29527 
29528 What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
29529 Bloom?
29530 
29531 In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
29532 dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before
29533 the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear
29534 melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom
29535 while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated
29536 gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.
29537 
29538 
29539 What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
29540 attention?
29541 
29542 The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.
29543 
29544 
29545 Why solitary (ipsorelative)?
29546 
29547 Brothers and sisters had he none. Yet that man's father was his
29548 grandfather's son._
29549 
29550 
29551 Why mutable (aliorelative)?
29552 
29553 From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.
29554 From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
29555 procreator.
29556 
29557 
29558 What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?
29559 
29560 The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
29561 and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles
29562 on the two bookshelves opposite.
29563

29628 
29629 
29630 What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of
29631 the inverted volumes?
29632 
29633 The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its
29634 place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:
29635 the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella
29636 inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document
29637 behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.

29647 
29648 The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
29649 decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).
29650 
29651 
29652 Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?
29653 
29654 Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
29655 interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult
29656 the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the
29657 military engagement, Plevna.
29658 
29659 
29660 What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?
29661 
29662 The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
29663 statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased
29664 by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.
29665 
29666 
29667 What caused him irritation in his sitting posture? Inhibitory pressure
29668 of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing
29669 superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations
29670 of mass by expansion.
29671 
29672 
29673 How was the irritation allayed?
29674 
29675 He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible
29676 stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He
29677 unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt
29678 and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs
29679 extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the
29680 circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial
29681 line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae,
29682 thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles
29683 described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits
29684 of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus
29685 one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.
29686 
29687 
29688 What involuntary actions followed?
29689 
29690 He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in
29691 the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting
29692 inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.
29693 He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of
29694 prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly
29695 abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of
29696 his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (I shilling),
29697 placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the
29698 interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

29769 Did the process of divestiture continue?
29770 
29771 Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended
29772 his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient
29773 points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in
29774 several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots,
29775 unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the
29776 second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the
29777 fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised
29778 his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender,
29779 took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin
29780 of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding
29781 part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and
29782 inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the
29783 lacerated ungual fragment.
29784 
29785 
29786 Why with satisfaction?
29787 
29788 Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
29789 ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
29790 Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
29791 genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.
29792 
29793 
29794 In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions
29795 now coalesced?
29796

29811 a distance from the nearest public thoroughfare as to render its
29812 houselights visible at night above and through a quickset hornbeam hedge
29813 of topiary cutting, situate at a given point not less than 1 statute
29814 mile from the periphery of the metropolis, within a time limit of not
29815 more than 15 minutes from tram or train line (e.g., Dundrum, south, or

29892 
29893 
29894 What might be the name of this erigible or erected residence?
29895 
29896 Bloom Cottage. Saint Leopold's. Flowerville.
29897 
29898 
29899 Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?
29900 
29901 In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful
29902 garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned
29903 young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a
29904 weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent
29905 of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving
29906 longevity.
29907 
29908 
29909 What syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?
29910 
29911 Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative
29912 to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the
29913 celestial constellations.
29914 
29915 
29916 What lighter recreations?
29917 
29918 Outdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways
29919 ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and
29920 unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge
29921 anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation),
29922 vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection
29923 of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers' fires of
29924 smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). Indoor: discussion in
29925 tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of
29926 unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox
29927 containing hammer, awl nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers,
29928 bullnose plane and turnscrew. Might he become a gentleman farmer of
29929 field produce and live stock?
29930 
29931 Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and
29932 requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper
29933 etc.
29934 
29935 
29936 What would be his civic functions and social status among the county
29937 families and landed gentry?
29938 
29939 Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that
29940 of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his
29941 career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest
29942 and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto _(Semper paratus_),
29943 duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C.,
29944 K. P., L. L. D. (_honoris causa_), Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in
29945 court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left
29946 Kingstown for England).
29947 
29948 
29949 What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?
29950 
29951 A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour:
29952 the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,
29953 incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality,
29954 of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants
29955 of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing
29956 with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to
29957 the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of
29958 rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order,
29959 the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every
29960 measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be
29961 contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter
29962 of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in
29963 covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations,
29964 all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of
29965 venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators
29966 of international persecution, all perpetuators of international
29967 animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all
29968 recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.
29969 
29970 
29971 Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.
29972 
29973 To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his
29974 disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his
29975 father Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the
29976 Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting
29977 Christianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of
29978 Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony
29979 in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile
29980 friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he
29981 had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of
29982 colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of
29983 Charles Darwin, expounded in _The Descent of Man_ and _The Origin
29984 of Species_. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the
29985 collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan
29986 Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others,
29987 the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of
29988 Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of
29989 peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for
29990 Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had
29991 climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree
29992 on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the
29993 capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000 torchbearers,
29994 divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2000 torches in escort of
29995 the marquess of Ripon and (honest) John Morley.
29996 
29997 
29998 How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?
29999 
30000 As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised
30001 Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum
30002 of 60 pounds per annum, being 1/6 of an assured income, derived from
30003 giltedged securities, representing at 5 % simple interest on capital of
30004 1200 pounds (estimate of price at 20 years' purchase), of which to be
30005 paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. 800
30006 pounds plus 2 1/2 % interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal
30007 annual instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for
30008 purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of
30009 64 pounds, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession
30010 of the lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale,
30011 foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure
30012 to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the absolute
30013 property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years
30014 stipulated.
30015 
30016 
30017 What rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate
30018 purchase?
30019 
30020 A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system
30021 the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of I or
30022 more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr
30023 8 m p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time), the message being received and
30024 available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time).
30025 The unexpected discovery of an object of great monetary value (precious
30026 stone, valuable adhesive or impressed postage stamps (7 schilling,
30027 mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866: 4 pence, rose, blue paper, perforate,
30028 Great Britain, 1855: 1 franc, stone, official, rouletted, diagonal
30029 surcharge, Luxemburg, 1878), antique dynastical ring, unique relic) in
30030 unusual repositories or by unusual means: from the air (dropped by an
30031 eagle in flight), by fire (amid the carbonised remains of an incendiated
30032 edifice), in the sea (amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict), on
30033 earth (in the gizzard of a comestible fowl). A Spanish prisoner's
30034 donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged
30035 with a solvent banking corporation loo years previously at 5% compound
30036 interest of the collective worth of 5,000,000 pounds stg (five million
30037 pounds sterling). A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the
30038 delivery of 32 consignments of some given commodity in consideration of
30039 cash payment on delivery per delivery at the initial rate of 1/4d to be
30040 increased constantly in the geometrical progression of 2 (1/4d, 1/2d,
30041 1d, 2d, 4d, 8d, 1s 4d, 2s 8d to 32 terms). A prepared scheme
30042 based on a study of the laws of probability to break the bank at Monte
30043 Carlo. A solution of the secular problem of the quadrature of the
30044 circle, government premium 1,000,000 pounds sterling.
30045 
30046 
30047 Was vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels?
30048 
30049 The reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the
30050 prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 15, by the
30051 cultivation of orange plantations and melonfields and reafforestation.
30052 The utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement
30053 possessing chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the
30054 first, vast number of the second and immense quantity of the third,
30055 every normal human being of average vitality and appetite producing
30056 annually, cancelling byproducts of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. (mixed
30057 animal and vegetable diet), to be multiplied by 4,386,035, the total
30058 population of Ireland according to census returns of 1901.
30059 
30060 
30061 Were there schemes of wider scope?
30062 
30063 A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour
30064 commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power),
30065 obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at
30066 head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main
30067 streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity.
30068 A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at Dollymount
30069 and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links and rifle
30070 ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting galleries,
30071 hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for mixed bathing.
30072 A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early
30073 morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish tourist traffic in
30074 and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats, plying in the
30075 fluvial fairway between Island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs, narrow
30076 gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation
30077 10/- per person per day, guide (trilingual) included). A scheme for
30078 the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways,
30079 when freed from weedbeds. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle
30080 Market (North Circular road and Prussia street) with the quays (Sheriff
30081 street, lower, and East Wall), parallel with the Link line railway
30082 laid (in conjunction with the Great Southern and Western railway line)
30083 between the cattle park, Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great
30084 Western Railway 43 to 45 North
30085 
30086 Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great
30087 Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam Packet
30088 Company, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and Glasgow
30089 Steam Packet Company, Glasgow, Dublin and Londonderry Steam Packet
30090 Company (Laird line), British and Irish Steam Packet Company, Dublin

30094 Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and for Liverpool
30095 Underwriters' Association, the cost of acquired rolling stock for
30096 animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the Dublin United
30097 Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers' fees.
30098 
30099 
30100 Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes
30101 become a natural and necessary apodosis?
30102 
30103 Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of
30104 gift and transfer vouchers during donor's lifetime or by bequest
30105 after donor's painless extinction, of eminent financiers (Blum Pasha,
30106 Rothschild Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller)
30107 possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and
30108 joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.
30109 
30110 
30111 What eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?
30112 
30113 The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.
30114 
30115 
30116 For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?
30117 
30118 It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic
30119 relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil
30120 recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for
30121 the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and
30122 renovated vitality.
30123 
30124 
30125 His justifications?
30126 
30127 As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human
30128 life at least 2/7, viz. 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher
30129 he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an
30130 infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised. As a
30131 physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant
30132 agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.
30133 
30134 
30135 What did he fear?
30136 
30137 The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration
30138 of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence
30139 situated in the cerebral convolutions.
30140 
30141 
30142 What were habitually his final meditations?
30143 
30144 Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in
30145 wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded,
30146 reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span
30147 of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.
30148 
30149 
30150 What did the first drawer unlocked contain?
30151

30202 
30203

30205 this thaumaturgic remedy.
30206 
30207 It heals and soothes while you sleep, in case of trouble in breaking

30215 
30216 
30217 Were there testimonials?
30218 
30219 Numerous. From clergyman, British naval officer, wellknown author, city
30220 man, hospital nurse, lady, mother of five, absentminded beggar.
30221 
30222 
30223 How did absentminded beggar's concluding testimonial conclude?
30224 
30225 What a pity the government did not supply our men with wonderworkers
30226 during the South African campaign! What a relief it would have been!
30227 
30228 
30229 What object did Bloom add to this collection of objects?
30230 
30231 A 4th typewritten letter received by Henry Flower (let H. F. be L. B.)
30232 from Martha Clifford (find M. C.).
30233 
30234 
30235 What pleasant reflection accompanied this action?
30236 
30237 The reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his magnetic
30238 face, form and address had been favourably received during the course of
30239 the preceding day by a wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie Powell),
30240 a nurse, Miss Callan (Christian name unknown), a maid, Gertrude (Gerty,
30241 family name unknown).
30242 
30243 
30244 What possibility suggested itself?
30245 
30246 The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not
30247 immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in
30248 the company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately
30249 mercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.
30250 
30251 
30252 What did the 2nd drawer contain?
30253 
30254 Documents: the birth certificate of Leopold Paula Bloom: an endowment

30268 
30269 
30270 Quote the textual terms of this notice.
30271 
30272 I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,
30273 formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice
30274 that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all
30275 times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.
30276 
30277 
30278 What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the
30279 2nd drawer?
30280 
30281 An indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolf Virag and his father Leopold
30282 Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their
30283 respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar,
30284 Hungary. An ancient haggadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex
30285 spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual
30286 prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen's Hotel,
30287 Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed: _To My Dear Son
30288 Leopold_.
30289 
30290 
30291 What fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words
30292 evoke?
30293 
30294 Tomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be
30295  with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her...
30296 all for me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son...
30297 always... of me... _das Herz... Gott... dein_...
30298 
30299 
30300 What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive
30301 melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?
30302 
30303 An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered,
30304 sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses
30305 of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the
30306 face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.
30307 
30308 
30309 Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?
30310 
30311 Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain
30312 beliefs and practices.
30313 
30314 
30315 As?
30316 
30317 The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the
30318 hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete
30319 mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of
30320 male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the
30321 ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.
30322 
30323 
30324 How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?
30325 
30326 Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than
30327 other beliefs and practices now appeared.
30328 
30329 
30330 What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?
30331 
30332 Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
30333 retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between
30334 Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with
30335 statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia,
30336 empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having
30337 taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
30338 Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant
30339 consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by
30340 suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the
30341 various centres mentioned.
30342 
30343 
30344 Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these
30345 migrations in narrator and listener?
30346 
30347 In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of
30348 narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of
30349 the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.
30350 
30351 
30352 What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of
30353 amnesia?
30354 
30355 Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.
30356 Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an
30357 inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food
30358 by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.
30359 
30360 
30361 What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?
30362 
30363 The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon
30364 repletion.
30365 
30366 
30367 What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?
30368 
30369 The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the
30370 possession of scrip.
30371 
30372 
30373 Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which
30374 these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values
30375 to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.
30376 
30377 Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor
30378 hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and
30379 doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy:
30380 that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d.
30381 in the pound, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant,
30382 insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated
30383 bailiffs man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric
30384 public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded
30385 perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House (Royal
30386 Hospital) Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced but
30387 respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of
30388 misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic
30389 pauper.
30390 
30391 
30392 With which attendant indignities?
30393 
30394 The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the
30395 contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread,
30396 the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of
30397 illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of
30398 decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less
30399 than nothing.
30400 
30401 
30402 By what could such a situation be precluded?
30403 
30404 By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).
30405 
30406 
30407 Which preferably?
30408 
30409 The latter, by the line of least resistance.
30410 
30411 
30412 What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?
30413 
30414 Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.
30415 The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity
30416 to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.
30417 
30418 
30419 What considerations rendered departure not irrational?
30420 
30421 The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which
30422 being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if
30423 not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,
30424 which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting
30425 parties, which was impossible.
30426 
30427 
30428 What considerations rendered departure desirable?
30429 
30430 The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,
30431 as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or
30432 in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and
30433 hachures.
30434 
30435 
30436 In Ireland?
30437 
30438 The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with
30439 submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort
30440 Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the
30441 pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island
30442 shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.
30443 
30444 
30445 Abroad?
30446 
30447 Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for
30448 Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame
30449 street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate
30450 of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique
30451 birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues of nude
30452 Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled
30453 international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where
30454 O'Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human
30455 being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters
30456 of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller
30457 returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.
30458 
30459 
30460 Under what guidance, following what signs?
30461 
30462 At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of
30463 intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior produced
30464 and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled
30465 triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha
30466 delta of Ursa Maior. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed
30467 in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice
30468 of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating
30469 female, a pillar of the cloud by day.
30470 
30471 
30472 What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?
30473 
30474 5 pounds reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles
30475 street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold
30476 Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may
30477 have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above
30478 sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.
30479 
30480 
30481 What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and
30482 nonentity?
30483 
30484 Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.
30485 
30486 
30487 What tributes his?
30488 
30489 Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph
30490 immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.
30491 
30492 
30493 Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?
30494 
30495 Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his
30496 cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic
30497 planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of
30498 space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere
30499 imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey
30500 the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of
30501 the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
30502 constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination
30503 return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark
30504 crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition)
30505 surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.
30506 
30507 
30508 What would render such return irrational?
30509 
30510 An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
30511 reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible
30512 time.
30513 
30514 
30515 What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?
30516 
30517 The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity
30518 of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,
30519 rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the
30520 proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of
30521 warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and
30522 rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,
30523 desired desire.
30524 
30525 
30526 What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an
30527 unoccupied bed?
30528 
30529 The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human
30530 mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of
30531 matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the
30532 case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the
30533 spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).
30534 
30535 
30536 What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of
30537 accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?
30538

30554 
30555 
30556 What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to
30557 conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?
30558 
30559 The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by
30560 the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.
30561 
30562 
30563 What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured
30564 multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not
30565 comprehend?
30566 
30567 Who was M'Intosh?
30568 
30569 
30570 What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30
30571 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction
30572 of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?
30573 
30574 Where was Moses when the candle went out?
30575 
30576 
30577 What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with
30578 collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel, silently,
30579 successively, enumerate?
30580 
30581 A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain
30582 a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,
30583 Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.
30584 C.): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in
30585 the case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous
30586 or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety
30587 Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.
30588 
30589 
30590 What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?
30591 
30592 The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin
30593 Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.
30594 
30595 
30596 What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?
30597 
30598 Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens
30599 street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines
30600 meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from
30601 infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the
30602 Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.
30603 
30604 
30605 What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were
30606 perceived by him?
30607 
30608 A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new
30609 violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on
30610 generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish
30611 cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded
30612 curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion
30613 underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed
30614 irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened,
30615 having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore
30616 side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).
30617 
30618 
30619 What impersonal objects were perceived?
30620 
30621 A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne
30622 cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat.
30623 Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware
30624 and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed
30625 irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish
30626 and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article
30627 on the floor, separate).
30628 
30629 
30630 Bloom's acts?
30631 
30632 He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining
30633 articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the
30634 bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the
30635 proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to
30636 the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the
30637 bed.
30638 
30639 
30640 How?
30641 
30642 With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or
30643 not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress
30644 being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous
30645 under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of
30646 lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of
30647 conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of
30648 marriage, of sleep and of death.
30649 
30650 
30651 What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?
30652 
30653 New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
30654 female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
30655 some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.
30656 
30657 
30658 If he had smiled why would he have smiled?
30659 
30660 To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
30661 enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
30662 the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
30663 last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor
30664 alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.
30665 
30666 
30667 What preceding series?
30668 
30669 Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
30670 d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
30671 Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show,
30672 Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor
30673 of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder,
30674 an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon
30675 Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John
30676 Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack
30677 at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so
30678 on to no last term.
30679 
30680 
30681 What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and
30682 late occupant of the bed?
30683 
30684 Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a
30685 billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a
30686 boaster).
30687 
30688 
30689 Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
30690 proportion and commercial ability?
30691 
30692 Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
30693 members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
30694 transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with
30695 desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene
30696 comprehension and apprehension.
30697 
30698 
30699 With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
30700 affected?
30701 
30702 Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.
30703 
30704 
30705 Envy?
30706 
30707 Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
30708 superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
30709 piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of
30710 a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
30711 female organism, passive but not obtuse.
30712 
30713 
30714 Jealousy?
30715 
30716 Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately
30717 the agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agent(s)
30718 and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of
30719 increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial
30720 reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
30721 attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.
30722 
30723 
30724 Abnegation?
30725 
30726 In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
30727 establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden
30728 Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
30729 reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
30730 ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
30731 extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative,
30732 e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net
30733 proceeds divided.
30734 
30735 
30736 Equanimity?
30737 
30738 As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
30739 understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance
30740 with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.
30741 As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in
30742 consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than
30743 theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money
30744 under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public
30745 money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of
30746 minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason,
30747 felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking,
30748 practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field,
30749 perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies,
30750 impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated
30751 murder. As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of
30752 adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal
30753 equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances,
30754 foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant
30755 disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.
30756 
30757 
30758 Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?
30759 
30760 From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
30761 outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
30762 violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the
30763 adulterously violated.
30764 
30765 
30766 What retribution, if any?
30767 
30768 Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by
30769 combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic
30770 bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit
30771 for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of
30772 injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. Hushmoney by moral
30773 influence possibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of
30774 emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral,
30775 a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation,
30776 humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other,
30777 protecting the separator from both.
30778 
30779 
30780 By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
30781 incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?
30782 
30783 The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility
30784 of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between
30785 the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the
30786 selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done; the fallaciously inferred
30787 debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of
30788 ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving
30789 no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as
30790 masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct
30791 feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist
30792 preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb
30793 and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary
30794 masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of
30795 seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by
30796 distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the
30797 inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy
30798 of the stars.
30799 
30800 
30801 In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and
30802 reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?
30803 
30804 Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial
30805 hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored
30806 the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of
30807 Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female
30808 hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and
30809 seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,
30810 insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,
30811 expressive of mute immutable mature animality.
30812 
30813 
30814 The visible signs of antesatisfaction?
30815 
30816 An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
30817 tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.
30818 
30819 
30820 Then?
30821 
30822 He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each
30823 plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure
30824 prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.
30825 
30826 
30827 The visible signs of postsatisfaction?
30828 
30829 A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a
30830 solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.
30831 
30832 
30833 What followed this silent action?
30834 
30835 Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,
30836 catechetical interrogation.
30837 
30838 
30839 With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?
30840 
30841 Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
30842 Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and
30843 in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,
30844 Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation
30845 and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),
30846 surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs
30847 Bandmann Palmer of LEAH at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King
30848 street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36 and
30849 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency
30850 entituled SWEETS OF SIN, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a
30851 temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the
30852 course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely
30853 recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving
30854 son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat
30855 executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor
30856 and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic
30857 flexibility.
30858 
30859 
30860 Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?
30861 
30862 Absolutely.
30863 
30864 
30865 Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?
30866 
30867 Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.
30868 
30869 
30870 What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
30871 perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the
30872 course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?
30873 
30874 By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
30875 celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
30876 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with
30877 female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated
30878 on the lo September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,
30879 with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last
30880 taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29
30881 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,
30882 aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days
30883 during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation
30884 of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation
30885 of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental
30886 intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since
30887 the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the
30888 female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained
30889 a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a
30890 preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
30891 consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of
30892 action had been circumscribed.
30893 
30894 
30895 How?
30896 
30897 By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
30898 destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration
30899 for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,
30900 projected or effected.
30901 
30902 
30903 What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible
30904 thoughts?
30905 
30906 The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
30907 concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.
30908 
30909 
30910 In what directions did listener and narrator lie?
30911 
30912 Listener, S. E. by E.: Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel
30913 of latitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45
30914 degrees to the terrestrial equator.
30915 
30916 
30917 In what state of rest or motion?
30918 
30919 At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each
30920 and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the
30921 proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of
30922 neverchanging space.
30923 
30924 
30925 In what posture?
30926 
30927 Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right
30928 leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the
30929 attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator:
30930 reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index
30931 finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in
30932 the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the
30933 childman weary, the manchild in the womb.
30934 
30935 
30936 Womb? Weary?
30937 
30938 He rests. He has travelled.
30939 
30940 
30941 With?
30942 
30943 Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and
30944 Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and
30945 Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad
30946 the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the
30947 Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.
30948 
30949 
30950 When?
30951 
30952 Going to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's auk's
30953 egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the
30954 Brightdayler.
30955 
30956 
30957 Where?
30958 
30959 
30960 
30961 Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
30962 breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel
30963 when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his
30964 highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan
30965 that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing
30966 all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually
30967 afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her
30968 ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes
30969 and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the
30970 world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks
30971 of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because
30972 no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder
30973 she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman
30974 certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there
30975 I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and
30976 always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like
30977 that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too
30978 hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything
30979 really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into
30980 a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it
30981 into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing
30982 on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun
30983 maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes
30984 because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman
30985 to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that
30986 dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at
30987 the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress
30988 Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the
30989 bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with
30990 her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to
30991 never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard
30992 a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and
30993 dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed
30994 get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what
30995 attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble
30996 they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its
30997 not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those
30998 night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he
30999 made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I
31000 meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see
31001 that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a
31002 young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked
31003 out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make
31004 up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of
31005 all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for
31006 I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some
31007 little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the
31008 sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before
31009 yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the
31010 front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told
31011 me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking
31012 about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks
31013 she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age
31014 especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she
31015 can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my
31016 bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with
31017 or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont
31018 have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary
31019 we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad
31020 enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice
31021 I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the
31022 long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen
31023 pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was
31024 all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could
31025 eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my
31026 house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see
31027 her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had
31028 something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he
31029 said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of
31030 oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to
31031 be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I
31032 found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little
31033 bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her
31034 weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the
31035 rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt
31036 I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even
31037 touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven
31038 like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in
31039 the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt
31040 possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last
31041 time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a
31042 great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another
31043 I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back
31044 singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea
31045 about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to
31046 the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case
31047 God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the
31048 same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do
31049 it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with
31050 him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn
31051 red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down
31052 on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour
31053 question and answer would you do this that and the other with the
31054 coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean
31055 or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was
31056 knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and
31057 so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging
31058 him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are
31059 you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german
31060 Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to
31061 make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this
31062 age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it
31063 pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway
31064 and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with
31065 all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time
31066 after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why
31067 cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes
31068 love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help
31069 yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there
31070 and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to
31071 your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used
31072 to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did
31073 where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your
31074 person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was
31075 it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and
31076 have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever
31077 way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father
31078 what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had
31079 a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither
31080 would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know
31081 me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed
31082 never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre
31083 lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone
31084 them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of
31085 incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if
31086 youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H
31087 H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I
31088 didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall
31089 though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking
31090 of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in
31091 it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of
31092 drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick
31093 their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green
31094 and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the
31095 opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that
31096 had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to
31097 keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the
31098 port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely
31099 and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped
31100 straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us
31101 I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I
31102 blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in
31103 Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and
31104 tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing
31105 about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that
31106 evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought
31107 its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church
31108 mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey
31109 matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the
31110 lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red
31111 brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they
31112 call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took
31113 off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and
31114 perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar
31115 standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he
31116 was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had
31117 one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole
31118 sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the
31119 middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all
31120 they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had
31121 to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in
31122 him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is
31123 so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last
31124 time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for
31125 him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it
31126 themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would
31127 believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing
31128 out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year
31129 as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one
31130 they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on
31131 it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of
31132 them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears
31133 supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like
31134 elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off
31135 him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child
31136 but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly
31137 I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about
31138 me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll
31139 do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene
31140 he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons
31141 housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account
31142 of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup
31143 row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a
31144 carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about
31145 everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew
31146 he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me
31147 so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup
31148 things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study
31149 up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could
31150 always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him
31151 after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he
31152 used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going
31153 to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byron's poems
31154 and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily
31155 get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in
31156 with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he
31157 refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the
31158 collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I
31159 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let
31160 him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes
31161 mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and
31162 ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool
31163 me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his
31164 plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own
31165 job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could
31166 hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking
31167 me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres
31168 something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was
31169 in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let
31170 out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let
31171 him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me
31172 Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and
31173 when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did
31174 you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on
31175 thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on
31176 the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what
31177 spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at
31178 that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he
31179 was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged
31180 afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of
31181 laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling
31182 out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great
31183 humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it
31184 meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us
31185 not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault
31186 she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes
31187 got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her
31188 face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she
31189 must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she
31190 was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him
31191 to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to
31192 go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine
31193 having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you
31194 any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy
31195 anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes
31196 in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes
31197 off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going
31198 about in his slippers to look for 10000 pounds for a postcard U p up
31199 O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to
31200 extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what
31201 could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry
31202 another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to
31203 put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows
31204 that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned
31205 her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was
31206 found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing
31207 like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad
31208 and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them
31209 for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on
31210 without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I
31211 wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek
31212 leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with
31213 the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if
31214 that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough
31215 to go and hang a woman surely are they
31216 
31217 theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
31218 noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C
31219 with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both
31220 ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his
31221 two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was
31222 what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches
31223 he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all
31224 myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I
31225 did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after
31226 some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times
31227 lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs
31228 Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning
31229 door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days
31230 after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was
31231 crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes
31232 that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a
31233 ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one
31234 and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend
31235 once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold
31236 and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire
31237 wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the
31238 hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots
31239 hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course
31240 hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I
31241 could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that
31242 mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition
31243 just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so
31244 polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was
31245 tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to
31246 make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I
31247 sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me
31248 straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot
31249 for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if
31250 you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he
31251 said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see
31252 anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now
31253 and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place
31254 too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing
31255 can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we
31256 were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was
31257 lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off
31258 my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed
31259 me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions
31260 is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it
31261 as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket
31262 of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen
31263 always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their
31264 skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with
31265 him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right
31266 against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me
31267 from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however
31268 standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on
31269 him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion
31270 and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there
31271 where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from
31272 anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but
31273 they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him
31274 coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping
31275 away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I
31276 halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my
31277 glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for
31278 the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers
31279 the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll
31280 to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look
31281 a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me
31282 hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat
31283 I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel
31284 down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new
31285 raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so
31286 savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched
31287 his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand
31288 to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find
31289 out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want
31290 to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father
31291 waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in
31292 the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me
31293 that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any
31294 woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met
31295 asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I
31296 wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was
31297 always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky
31298 man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake
31299 dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course
31300 it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in
31301 Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children
31302 seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice
31303 a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman
31304 when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote
31305 the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it
31306 simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to
31307 embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the
31308 same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you
31309 think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or
31310 the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface
31311 Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after
31312 dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me
31313 professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his
31314 way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you
31315 have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought
31316 it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I
31317 was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a
31318 fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been
31319 a bit late because it was l/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls
31320 coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me
31321 never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw
31322 the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was
31323 whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my
31324 clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go
31325 to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary
31326 the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel
31327 were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt
31328 tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps
31329 some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed
31330 never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a
31331 husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did
31332 anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where
31333 he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the
31334 Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of
31335 us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup
31336 splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter
31337 after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the
31338 engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen
31339 in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so
31340 pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was
31341 able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on
31342 to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting
31343 in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take
31344 a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the
31345 guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at
31346 us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an
31347 exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage
31348 that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him l or 2
31349 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer

31357 put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going

31370 my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be
31371 seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never
31372 felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul
31373 and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them
31374 instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were
31375 with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so
31376 bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the
31377 Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay
31378 from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham
31379 battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the
31380 march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the
31381 lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his
31382 money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a
31383 nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up
31384 there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I
31385 had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going
31386 round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave
31387 this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the
31388 knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or
31389 tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and
31390 smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes
31391 not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find
31392 out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked
31393 close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression
31394 besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big
31395 hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having
31396 to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way
31397 Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and
31398 stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild
31399 with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes
31400 them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks
31401 with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off I know by
31402 the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect
31403 devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up
31404 the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost
31405 over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of
31406 Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making
31407 free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over
31408 the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his
31409 dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert
31410 when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked
31411 every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty
31412 and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat
31413 everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked
31414 silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into
31415 my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for
31416 money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to
31417 be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be
31418 noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I
31419 want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know
31420 what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and
31421 half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made
31422 them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of
31423 what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered
31424 after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this
31425 morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to
31426 upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole
31427 thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in
31428 the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have
31429 but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line
31430 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to
31431 reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the
31432 stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from
31433 ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they
31434 call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a
31435 bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get
31436 anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or
31437 I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good
31438 might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters
31439 that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me
31440 out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion
31441 I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him
31442 over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget
31443 it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him 111 know by
31444 the bottle anyway if not I suppose 111 only have to wash in my piss like
31445 beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought
31446 it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much
31447 finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity
31448 it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all
31449 sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and
31450 rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always
31451 want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if
31452 I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how
31453 much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and
31454 jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting
31455 up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and
31456 women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all
31457 the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life
31458 up to 35 no Im what am I at all 111 be 33 in September will I what O
31459 well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when
31460 I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman
31461 magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like
31462 that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning
31463 to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it
31464 pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry
31465 the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like
31466 the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all
31467 made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what
31468 was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what
31469 was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind
31470 of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster
31471 knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings
31472 me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about
31473 a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for
31474 any priest to write and her a--e as if any fool wouldnt know what that
31475 meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards
31476 face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants
31477 he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 5 o the part
31478 about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate
31479 sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he
31480 drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like
31481 the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms
31482 sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought
31483 first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber
31484 when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H
31485 he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too
31486 where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might
31487 have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as
31488 I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings
31489 he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get
31490 regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count
31491 the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house
31492 so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed
31493 even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending
31494 to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr
31495 Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up
31496 I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great
31497 mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and
31498 truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress
31499 that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre
31500 coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was
31501 no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Bums
31502 as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a
31503 lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me
31504 altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and
31505 cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if
31506 I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes
31507 take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles
31508 off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my
31509 backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton
31510 street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as
31511 ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too
31512 much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was
31513 awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked
31514 Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very
31515 hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of
31516 him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me
31517 without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and
31518 me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was
31519 out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you
31520 were
31521 
31522 yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he
31523 made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow
31524 stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up
31525 and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him
31526 what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same
31527 in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there
31528 like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with
31529 her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks
31530 like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of
31531 him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a
31532 cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or
31533 that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue
31534 of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing
31535 standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the
31536 Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them
31537 theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed
31538 outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to
31539 try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was I of the
31540 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night
31541 coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade
31542 to make you feel nice and watery I went into r of them it was so biting
31543 cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was
31544 a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see
31545 me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of
31546 it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not
31547 afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the
31548 woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a
31549 picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the
31550 job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee
31551 palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only
31552 shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo
31553 he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and
31554 that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some
31555 jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply
31556 the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of
31557 the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his
31558 teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent
31559 they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly
31560 enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a
31561 pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate
31562 looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly
31563 caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to
31564 my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he
31565 got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him
31566 to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than
31567 cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I
31568 declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember
31569 the I half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master
31570 Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them
31571 Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they
31572 want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a
31573 woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was
31574 here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel
31575 all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd
31576 time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes
31577 with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout
31578 out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look
31579 ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you
31580 want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some
31581 of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does
31582 it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose
31583 from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage
31584 brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait

31620 whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for
31621 example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in

31624 the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting
31625 bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas

31634 the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the
31635 storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting
31636 in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he
31637 got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with
31638 father and captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the
31639 windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like
31640 all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked
31641 at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was
31642 attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent
31643 looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in
31644 the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the
31645 excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been
31646 nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me
31647 the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East
31648 Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by
31649 that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he

31654 O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent
31655 nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his
31656 fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift
31657 drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair
31658 when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa
31659 cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night
31660 and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems
31661 centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address
31662 right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always
31663 going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the
31664 boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers
31665 uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was
31666 very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing
31667 she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near
31668 it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap
31669 of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very
31670 peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull
31671 as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out
31672 of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage
31673 waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed
31674 his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop
31675 especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all
31676 directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant
31677 whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the
31678 ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood
31679 dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old
31680 bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate
31681 poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place
31682 more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites
31683 assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and
31684 the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and
31685 only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and
31686 sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for
31687 them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the
31688 windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think
31689 of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot
31690 himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse
31691 paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed
31692 do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of
31693 galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living
31694 soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so
31695 bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab
31696 with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah
31697 aheah all my compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now
31698 with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a
31699 nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the
31700 nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show
31701 I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never
31702 understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster

31746 
31747 Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio
31748 brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her
31749 to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin
31750 to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her
31751 in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her
31752 appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a loo her face a mass of wrinkles
31753 with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the
31754 Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack
31755 flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took
31756 all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in
31757 Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was
31758 a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed
31759 virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter
31760 Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing
31761 the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer
31762 he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when
31763 I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then
31764 he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an
31765 appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up
31766 in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to
31767 find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember
31768 shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to
31769 near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my
31770 sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till
31771 he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my
31772 knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was
31773 engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de
31774 la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years
31775 time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that
31776 bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be
31777 imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt
31778 have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he
31779 brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I
31780 taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was
31781 too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant
31782 king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new
31783 fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower
31784 I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes
31785 they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each
31786 others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing
31787 the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear
31788 he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to
31789 encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just
31790 beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove
31791 a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the
31792 galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels
31793 cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and
31794 ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the
31795 monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like
31796 chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could
31797 do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love
31798 doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white
31799 ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the
31800 best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I
31801 could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment
31802 but I wouldnt lee him he was awfully put out first for fear you never
31803 know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant
31804 Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried
31805 with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me
31806 somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was
31807 up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there
31808 where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and
31809 then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres
31810 a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it
31811 off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to
31812 be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my
31813 petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the
31814 life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel
31815 rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was
31816 shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little
31817 when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and
31818 drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men
31819 down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me
31820 what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant
31821 he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to
31822 the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said
31823 hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married
31824 hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me
31825 now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly
31826 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and
31827 put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young
31828 still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is
31829 quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she
31830 little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt
31831 of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might
31832 say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit
31833 wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady
31834 Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons
31835 screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round
31836 by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out
31837 the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he
31838 didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore
31839 crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat
31840 that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans
31841 higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak
31842 caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I
31843 suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my
31844 name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a
31845 visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre
31846 looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better
31847 than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them
31848 Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad
31849 about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she
31850 was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely
31851 one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to
31852 Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they
31853 were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now
31854 when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping
31855 up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and
31856 throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those
31857 men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they
31858 might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be
31859 drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats
31860 that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the
31861 sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock
31862 from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I
31863 could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas
31864 mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry
31865 Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at
31866 mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and
31867 weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there
31868 was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau
31869 dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I
31870 wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for
31871 luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed
31872 him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as
31873 if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must
31874 have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could
31875 you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that

31930 summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then

31939 buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of
31940 the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg
31941 wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the
31942 stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play
31943 with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she
31944 fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their
31945 claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when

31964 with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if
31965 anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say
31966 yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the
31967 weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the
31968 left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his
31969 oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can
31970 swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in
31971 his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before
31972 all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was
31973 black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed
31974 chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City
31975 Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he
31976 wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no
31977 love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book
31978 he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de
31979 Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his
31980 tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes
31981 all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all
31982 blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of
31983 the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay
31984 round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens
31985 baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall
31986 old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to
31987 get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like
31988 being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have
31989 to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved
31990 in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor
31991 drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go
31992 and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like
31993 all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw
31994 through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the
31995 honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he
31996 had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O
31997 how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if
31998 not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a
31999 leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving
32000 us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust
32001 with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to
32002 prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he
32003 was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and
32004 murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or
32005 whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy
32006 till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again
32007 being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot
32008 or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor
32009 old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not
32010 that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure
32011 I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a
32012 candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet
32013 frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could
32014 for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows
32015 still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for
32016 him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account
32017 of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed
32018 have to learn not like me getting all IS at school only hed do a thing
32019 like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did
32020 it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn
32021 round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave
32022 me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair
32023 against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove
32024 get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase
32025 with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off
32026 that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before
32027 she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant
32028 see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of
32029 course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking
32030 to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she
32031 pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the
32032 house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of
32033 fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with
32034 her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and
32035 laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see
32036 now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating
32037 me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly
32038 come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her
32039 round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well
32040 he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to
32041 go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I
32042 smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button
32043 I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I
32044 tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a
32045 parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out
32046 no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste
32047 your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle
32048 blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on
32049 show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at
32050 her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on
32051 you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the
32052 Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching
32053 me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that
32054 touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always
32055 trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for
32056 Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed
32057 like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me
32058 there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to
32059 get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same
32060 little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but
32061 he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the
32062 Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance
32063 on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands
32064 swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything
32065 deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the
32066 wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that
32067 Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with
32068 sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he
32069 looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and
32070 supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man
32071 gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a
32072 few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really
32073 happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their
32074 natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that
32075 would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the
32076 head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself
32077 after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making
32078 love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up
32079 at I S my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that
32080 all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her
32081 lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use
32082 going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when
32083 I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe
32084 Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her
32085 trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2
32086 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering
32087 me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of
32088 course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was
32089 a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it
32090 and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that
32091 because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he
32092 doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the
32093 teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place
32094 its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of
32095 getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant
32096 again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed
32097 revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be
32098 walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and
32099 farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good
32100 job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the
32101 dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out
32102 the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he
32103 walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially
32104 Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with
32105 his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his
32106 sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those
32107 prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing
32108 over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear
32109 a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt
32110 enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he
32111 right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers
32112 might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed
32113 ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them
32114 he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the
32115 fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her
32116 paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them
32117 disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its

32127 on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn
32128 gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he
32129 did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I
32130 wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with
32131 his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his
32132 soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I
32133 could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to
32134 sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in
32135 a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the
32136 gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and
32137 had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after
32138 to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat
32139 itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O
32140 patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make
32141 me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just
32142 put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn
32143 it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin
32144 for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a
32145 widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry
32146 juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of
32147 sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and
32148 cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens
32149 I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I
32150 suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom
32151 I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut
32152 all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl
32153 wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on
32154 me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a
32155 holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder
32156 was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair
32157 purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other
32158 room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my
32159 breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one
32160 time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O
32161 Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some
32162 fellow 111 have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he
32163 never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the
32164 smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a
32165 peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman
32166 O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the
32167 waters come down at Lahore
32168 
32169 who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I
32170 something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was
32171 it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the
32172 doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white
32173 thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr
32174 Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I
32175 suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round
32176 those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little
32177 fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so
32178 theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in
32179 the world besides theres something queer about their children always
32180 smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did
32181 had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold
32182 maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face
32183 for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you
32184 pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of
32185 Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the
32186 way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can
32187 squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles
32188 still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys
32189 when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same
32190 paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking
32191 me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words
32192 they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I
32193 wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else
32194 still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so
32195 severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O
32196 anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot
32197 that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters
32198 my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything
32199 underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever
32200 something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at
32201 myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure
32202 O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was
32203 coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how
32204 the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we
32205 stood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere
32206 I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used
32207 to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him
32208 and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament
32209 O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule
32210 and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the
32211 Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine
32212 that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion
32213 and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he
32214 as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton
32215 square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to
32216 wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the
32217 gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better
32218 not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a
32219 natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to
32220 do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits
32221 he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he
32222 without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out
32223 all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god
32224 he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all
32225 yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes
32226 sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and
32227 Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always
32228 imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed
32229 too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking
32230 thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old
32231 press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time
32232 somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of
32233 course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope
32234 theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves
32235 up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly
32236 bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it
32237 often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used
32238 to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O
32239 I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many
32240 houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard
32241 street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on
32242 the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the
32243 men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse
32244 and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always
32245 somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them
32246 always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right
32247 something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr
32248 Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old
32249 lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives
32250 impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the
32251 Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the
32252 freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling
32253 along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much
32254 consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed
32255 judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres
32256 Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well
32257 thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody
32258 climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that
32259 little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if
32260 he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I
32261 dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies
32262 then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you
32263 then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece
32264 he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life
32265 without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more
32266 with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the
32267 kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in
32268 their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then
32269 tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose
32270 Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one
32271 night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor
32272 half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged
32273 to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be
32274 petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does
32275 it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too
32276 flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do
32277 it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the
32278 coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head
32279 with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage
32280 with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her
32281 Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call
32282 him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was
32283 with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs
32284 bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing
32285 his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to
32286 wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this
32287 is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the
32288 grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers
32289 funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse
32290 walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little
32291 barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk
32292 in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and
32293 Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in
32294 her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and
32295 her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other
32296 way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call
32297 that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with
32298 their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that
32299 barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick
32300 or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though
32301 hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well
32302 theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can
32303 help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes
32304 on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every
32305 penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and
32306 family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a
32307 way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was
32308 insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and
32309 her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows
32310 weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if
32311 youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner
32312 and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail
32313 to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and
32314 grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty
32315 didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a
32316 spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for
32317 that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he
32318 was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the
32319 old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the
32320 hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana
32321 with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious
32322 voice Phoebe dearest goodbye _sweet_heart sweetheart he always sang it
32323 not like Bartell Darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of
32324 the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath
32325 O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too
32326 high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to
32327 May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of
32328 it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author
32329 and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons
32330 what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I
32331 ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion
32332 still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it
32333 altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the
32334 Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats
32335 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into
32336 mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was
32337 enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course
32338 he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by
32339 this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his
32340 lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I
32341 saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by
32342 God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid
32343 out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met
32344 before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either
32345 besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after
32346 that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on
32347 its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise
32348 in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look
32349 at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about
32350 poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or
32351 standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only
32352 getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry
32353 when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not
32354 an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I
32355 wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15
32356 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose
32357 hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not
32358 that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting
32359 down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of
32360 course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was
32361 out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not
32362 a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson
32363 they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont
32364 find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where
32365 poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully
32366 coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point
32367 the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back
32368 there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that
32369 for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly
32370 bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star
32371 itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk
32372 to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad
32373 and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their
32374 business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to
32375 meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those
32376 fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the
32377 side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something
32378 and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that
32379 thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he
32380 bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders
32381 his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you
32382 I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock
32383 there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was
32384 looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks
32385 with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went
32386 down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed
32387 be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of
32388 washing it from I years end to the other the most of them only thats
32389 what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only
32390 get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing
32391 in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing
32392 the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can
32393 find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think
32394 me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the
32395 other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under
32396 me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2
32397 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am
32398 I going to do about him though
32399 
32400 no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no
32401 nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because
32402 I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a
32403 cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place
32404 pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so
32405 barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar
32406 way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a
32407 butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course
32408 hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might
32409 as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something
32410 better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because
32411 they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist
32412 they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure
32413 they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I
32414 wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they
32415 have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you
32416 touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying
32417 passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy
32418 because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me
32419 blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long
32420 into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle
32421 in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they
32422 please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different
32423 tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be
32424 always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear
32425 once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we
32426 all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it
32427 out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it
32428 hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other
32429 mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even
32430 casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants
32431 and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to
32432 know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old
32433 shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing
32434 me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I
32435 suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at
32436 him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent I atom of any
32437 kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever

32439 I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss
32440 our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked
32441 ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day
32442 almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love
32443 or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the
32444 Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark
32445 evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be
32446 hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate
32447 somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their
32448 camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if
32449 they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model
32450 laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that
32451 blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me
32452 in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer
32453 anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats
32454 that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the
32455 night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing
32456 match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and
32457 the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was
32458 a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes
32459 home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are
32460 rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for
32461 the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so
32462 well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if
32463 he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to
32464 sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for
32465 Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around
32466 down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled
32467 up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like
32468 to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt
32469 I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be
32470 governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one
32471 another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk
32472 like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses
32473 yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they
32474 wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to
32475 be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be
32476 if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats
32477 why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books
32478 and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I
32479 suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that
32480 theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my
32481 fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind
32482 in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I
32483 suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I
32484 knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well
32485 Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same
32486 since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any
32487 more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was
32488 somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting
32489 God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt
32490 like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a
32491 lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of
32492 the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants
32493 what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I
32494 hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a
32495 dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us
32496 so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa
32497 in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young
32498 hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah
32499 what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz
32500 Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of
32501 Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las
32502 Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a
32503 name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like
32504 her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and
32505 Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small
32506 blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I
32507 dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round
32508 any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent
32509 forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the
32510 name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel
32511 cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all
32512 upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can
32513 tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not
32514 so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead
32515 tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his
32516 breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on
32517 the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the
32518 watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the
32519 kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines
32520 I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the
32521 other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to
32522 introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his
32523 wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods
32524 notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things
32525 come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us
32526 why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room
32527 he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the
32528 scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning
32529 like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it for 2 Im sure
32530 Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes
32531 a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an
32532 intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red
32533 slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a
32534 nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom
32535 dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill
32536 just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of
32537 Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all
32538 the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of
32539 splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st
32540 man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used
32541 to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a
32542 big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the
32543 longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup
32544 she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream
32545 too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a
32546 bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to
32547 go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let
32548 him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill
32549 let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is I s l o fucked yes
32550 and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times
32551 handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt
32552 bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe
32553 me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a
32554 mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve
32555 him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in
32556 the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in
32557 this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they
32558 hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or
32559 He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he
32560 wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out
32561 in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole
32562 as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want LI or perhaps 30/-
32563 Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he
32564 wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women
32565 do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his
32566 name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up
32567 besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he
32568 doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do
32569 the indifferent l or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like
32570 that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my
32571 bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or

32575 which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have
32576 to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell
32577 never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you

32579 omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is
32580 she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an
32581 unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out
32582 their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus

32600 roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then
32601 the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields
32602 of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going
32603 about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers
32604 all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the
32605 ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no
32606 God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why
32607 dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever
32608 they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then
32609 they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre
32610 afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them

32612 that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you
32613 are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun
32614 shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on
32615 Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to
32616 propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth
32617 and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long
32618 kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain
32619 yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he
32620 said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I
32621 liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew
32622 I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could
32623 leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first
32624 only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many
32625 things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and
32626 old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop
32627 and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front
32628 of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil
32629 half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their
32630 tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and
32631 the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and
32632 Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons
32633 and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the
32634 cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts
32635 of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those
32636 handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit
32637 down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the
32638 posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron
32639 and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we
32640 missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his
32641 lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson
32642 sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the
32643 Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink
32644 and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and
32645 geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower
32646 of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian
32647 girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the
32648 Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked
32649 him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to
32650 say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and
32651 drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his
32652 heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.
